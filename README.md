# Final Fantasy IV:  Falcon Dive

Welcome to Final Fantasy IV's latest randomizer (as of July 3, 2023 :) ), Falcon Dive!  This is based off of Final Fantasy IV:  Free Enterprise, an open world randomizer for FF4 for the SNES.  This randomizer is based off the Pixel Remaster version.

To see differences between Free Enterprise and Falcon Dive, please see this Google Sheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lULu47K_qzDfWUxVXHlzmDaYO1RL7CbF3A2cvBa1OXk/edit?usp=sharing

## Installation
- For all installations, you will need to download two files:
  - FF4FalconDive.zip, the main randomizer program, which you can download here:  https://github.com/gameboy9/FF4FalconDive/releases/latest/download/FF4FalconDive.zip
  - GameAssets.zip, which consists of the base game files, which you can download here:  https://github.com/gameboy9/FF4FalconDive/releases/download/1.0/GameAssets.zip
  - **NOTE:**  We recommend not placing the randomizer program nor GameAssets.zip in the same folder as your FF4: Pixel Remaster folder.

### Mandatory Setup:
- Click Browse next to the "FF4 PR Folder" Text box and find your FF4 Install Location (This can be found in steam by right clicking on FF4 PR and selecting "Properties" then "Installed Files" Then clicking "Browse") 
  - Note: The folder should be named "FINAL FANTASY IV PR".
- Click Browse next to the "Game Assets Folder" Text box and find the GameAssets.zip you downloaded above.
- Then Click Extract. This may take a few minutes to complete.
- You will get a extract complete at the bottom of the application when finished

### Optional Setup:
- Select your randomization options from the General, Heroes, and Enemies tabs.

### Finishing Up:
- Then click "Randomize!" after a moment you should get a "Complete!" along with a checksum for reference if needed. 
- Go back into Steam and start your FF4 Falcon Dive Experience.

**NOTE:**  To revert back to vanilla, all you have to do is click "Revert to vanilla", which will delete everything randomizer related from the Steam directory, and you're all set!
