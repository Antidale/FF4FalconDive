E0001_01_342_a_01	Captain, we will arrive at Baron shortly.
E0001_01_342_a_02	...Very well.
E0001_01_342_a_03	The captain seems kinda down.
E0001_01_342_a_04	After what we did, who wouldn't be?<P>\nOrders are orders, but killing innocent people to get the Crystals isn't right.
E0001_03_342_a_01	The Red Wings are supposed to protect people, not harm them!
E0001_03_342_a_02	That's enough!
E0001_03_342_a_03	But Captain!
E0001_03_342_a_04	Surely you don't condone what we've done?
E0001_03_342_a_05	All of you, listen well. The raid on Mysidia was imperative for Baron's prosperity.<P>\nThe Mysidians know too much about the Crystals—their very possession of one is a threat to Baron.<P>\nHis Majesty ordered we obtain their Crystal, and as soldiers of the Royal Air Force, we are sworn to obey.
E0001_03_342_a_06	Captain...
E0001_03_342_a_07	Captain! Monsters sighted dead ahead!
E0001_03_342_a_08	Prepare for battle!
E0001_04_342_a_01	Ugh...
E0001_04_342_a_02	Are you alright!?
E0001_04_342_a_03	We've got more hostiles!
E0001_04_342_a_04	Damnation!
E0001_05_342_a_01	Is everyone okay?
E0001_05_342_a_02	All accounted for, sir.
E0001_05_342_a_03	We've been encountering more monsters than ever lately...
E0001_05_342_a_04	There's no end to them!
E0001_05_342_a_05	Could it be...some kind of omen?
E0001_05_342_a_06	Captain, we are now approaching Baron.
E0001_05_342_a_07	Very well. Prepare for landing.
E0001_07_004_a_01	Well done! So the Crystal is now ours.
E0001_07_004_a_02	The Mysidians put up no resistance. In fact, they were completely defenseless.
E0001_07_004_a_03	Is this pity I perceive? Hmph! Come, Captain. His Majesty awaits.
E0001_10_007_a_01	If you'll excuse me, Captain, I must speak to His Majesty in private. Please wait here.
E0001_11_008_a_01	Your Majesty, I am afraid (CECIL) can no longer be trusted. He clearly questions your authority.
E0001_11_008_a_02	He does!? Your counsel is well heeded, Baigan.<P>\nBut so long as I obtain the Crystals, (CECIL)'s transgressions matter little. Send him in.
E0001_11_008_a_03	Yes, Your Majesty.
E0001_11_008_a_04	Captain! His Majesty summons you.
E0001_11_008_a_05	The Kingdom of Baron hails your return. May I have the Crystal?
E0001_11_008_a_06	Yes, Your Majesty.
E0001_11_008_a_07	Handed over the Water Crystal.
E0001_11_008_a_08	It looks genuine to me, sire.
E0001_11_008_a_09	It is...beautiful to behold... You are dismissed, (CECIL).
E0001_11_008_a_10	Your Majesty!
E0001_11_008_a_11	Yes?
E0001_11_008_a_12	Captain, what is it?
E0001_11_008_a_13	Your Majesty, forgive me, but what are your intentions regarding the Crystals?<P>\nMy men are confused and displeased at their orders.
E0001_11_008_a_14	And what of you? Do you question my command?
E0001_11_008_a_15	No! I only ask—
E0001_11_008_a_16	Silence! Do not think your treachery has slipped past me!<P>\nI trusted you, (CECIL), but you leave me no choice. I hereby relieve you of command of the Red Wings!
E0001_11_008_a_24	Your Majesty!
E0001_11_008_a_17	Now, I charge you with another duty.<P>\nSlay the phantom beast that plagues Mist Valley, and deliver this bomb ring to the village of Mist.<P>\nYou leave tomorrow, at first light.
E0001_11_008_a_18	Your Majesty, I beg you to reconsider.
E0001_11_008_a_19	(CECIL) has done no wrong.
E0001_11_008_a_20	Ah, (CAIN). If you are so concerned about your traitorous friend, you may accompany him!
E0001_11_008_a_25	Your Majesty!
E0001_11_008_a_21	Now, take the ring and begone!
E0001_11_008_a_22	Received Bomb Ring.
E0001_11_008_a_23	Your Majesty!
E0001_12_006_a_01	I'm sorry, (CAIN).
E0001_12_006_a_02	Once we've completed the mission, the king is bound to forgive us both.<P>\nYou'll command the Red Wings again in no time.
E0001_12_006_a_03	...
E0001_12_006_a_04	Get some rest. Leave tomorrow's preparations to me.
E0101_00_006_a_01	What's wrong?
E0101_00_006_a_02	...I'm sorry to have dragged you into this.
E0101_00_006_a_03	Don't be. I acted of my own free will.
E0101_00_006_a_04	I mastered the dark sword on His Majesty's orders. But it was to protect Baron, not to plunder.
E0101_00_006_a_05	You're not to blame. I'm sure the king has his reasons.
E0101_00_006_a_06	I envy you, (CAIN). I envy the path you chose.
E0101_00_006_a_07	I suppose I could've attained a higher rank, had I become a dark knight.<P>\nMy father was a dragoon, but he passed away when I was still young.<P>\nI felt that I could keep some sort of connection with him if I became a dragoon as well.
E0101_00_006_a_08	...
E0101_00_006_a_09	I didn't mean to bore you with my stories. Anyway, I don't need your concern.<P>\nThe only thing you should be concerned about is slaying that beast tomorrow.<P>\nI don't want to be the only one pulling his weight.
E0101_00_006_a_10	I'll give as good as you, rest assured!
E0101_00_006_a_11	That's more like it.<P>\nWe should get some sleep. We rise early tomorrow.
E0002_00_009_a_01	(CECIL)!
E0002_00_009_a_02	Thank goodness you're alright. I was so worried. You left on such short notice.
E0002_00_009_a_03	We're fine. I wish I could say the same for the Mysidians we slaughtered...
E0002_00_009_a_06	(CECIL)!
E0002_00_009_a_04	I'll come see you later, okay?
E0002_00_009_a_05	Very well...
E0003_00_004_a_01	Well, well, well. Look who's back. (ROZA) was worried sick about you.
E0003_00_004_a_02	Don't you ever do that to her again, you hear?<P>\nSo, how are my airships? I'll bet you and your goons wrecked them up something awful.<P>\nHey, what's the matter with you, kiddo?
E0003_00_004_a_03	Well...
E0003_00_004_a_04	What!? The king demoted you?<P>\nWhat about the Red Wings? They'll be a mess without you!<P>\nCome to think of it, the king's been acting peculiar for some time.<P>\nHis Majesty ordered me to build an airship for killing people! Everyone's worried about him...<P>\nAnyhoo, be careful out there! Make short work of that mission and get back safe.<P>\n...Whoa, I have to start heading home! My daughter will kill me if I'm not back soon!
E0004_00_014_a_01	I've changed your sheets, sir. I hear you depart early tomorrow morning. Good night.
E0005_00_015_a_01	What's happened to the king? He covets the Crystals as though he's possessed.<P>\nAnd it seems he'll resort to any means to get them... Nevertheless, I can't defy him.<P>\nHow could I cross the man who raised (CAIN) and me like his very own? The chivalrous knight whom I've adored and admired since childhood? I will not betray him. I can't.
E0005_00_015_a_14	(CECIL)!
E0005_00_015_a_02	What's going on? You just returned from Mysidia, and now you must journey afar to battle some phantom beast? It's all too sudden.
E0005_00_015_a_03	Everything's fine.
E0005_00_015_a_04	(CECIL), look at me.
E0005_00_015_a_05	...In Mysidia, we killed innocent people to steal their Crystal. It was horrible.<P>\nBut I suppose this is my fate as a dark knight. Soon, I won't even feel remorse for my actions.
E0005_00_015_a_06	You and I both know that will never happen.
E0005_00_015_a_07	Still, I can't defy the king... I'm a hopeless coward.
E0005_00_015_a_08	The (CECIL) I know would never whimper like this!<P>\nThe (CECIL) I love...
E0005_00_015_a_09	You leave for Mist early tomorrow, right?
E0005_00_015_a_10	Yes, but don't worry. (CAIN)'s coming too.
E0005_00_015_a_11	I'll be fine. Trust me.
E0005_00_015_a_12	Please come back to me in one piece.
E0005_00_015_a_13	Thank you, (ROZA)...<P>\nThough as a dark knight, you know we can never truly be together...
E0006_00_005_a_01	So, are you ready for some real combat?
E0006_00_005_a_02	Always.
E0006_00_005_a_03	Lead the way.
E0033_00_005_a_01	Sir (CECIL)!
E0033_00_005_a_02	So good of you to return.
E0033_00_005_a_03	Baigan, not you too...
E0033_00_005_a_04	Is something the matter?
E0033_00_005_a_05	You serve Golbez as well?
E0033_00_005_a_06	Never! As captain of the Royal Guards, my loyalty lies with Baron.
E0033_00_005_a_07	Where's (CID)? I heard he's being held prisoner.
E0033_00_005_a_08	I was looking for him myself, but my men and I were attacked. I was the only survivor...
E0033_00_005_a_09	I see. Then you must join us.
E0033_00_005_a_10	It would be an honor.
E0033_00_005_a_11	Captain Baigan of the Royal Guards has joined the party.
E0033_00_005_a_12	What is it?
E0033_00_005_a_13	Something's wrong.
E0033_00_005_a_14	Yes. I sense danger.
E0033_00_005_a_15	What!? Like...a...monster?
E0033_00_005_a_16	Oh, give me a break, mister.
E0033_00_005_a_17	Sir, no disrespect, but that acting of yours is about as subtle as a crutch.
E0033_00_005_a_18	Baigan! You've betrayed Baron too!?
E0033_00_005_a_19	Golbez's wishes are Baron's wishes. And he granted a wonderful power to me. Observe!
E0033_01_005_a_01	Ha! Nothing to it!
E0033_01_005_a_02	Baigan always seemed so loyal...
E0034_00_008_a_01	(CECIL), you have returned! I am glad to see you are safe.
E0034_00_008_a_02	Thank you.
E0034_00_008_a_03	I see you have become a paladin. Paladins are of little use—a dark knight would be much more valuable to us.
E0034_00_008_a_04	Your Majesty?
E0034_00_008_a_05	Your who? Oh, you must mean the old duffer who refused to surrender his kingdom.<P>\nHahaha, I must say I've enjoyed impersonating him.
E0034_00_008_a_06	What have you done with the king!?
E0034_00_008_a_07	You'll see him soon enough. Oh, and give my regards to Scarmiglione if you run into him in the netherworld.<P>\nThat weakling never deserved to be one of the four Elemental Lords. The rest of us are more powerful than him.
E0034_00_008_a_08	Then you are...!?
E0034_00_008_a_09	Behold! I am the Lord of Water, Cagnazzo!
E0034_00_008_b_01	Torrents of water begin to build!
E0034_00_008_b_02	Turtle defense!
E0034_00_008_b_03	Thunder breaks the barrier!
E0034_01_008_a_01	You dirty rotten impostor!
E0034_01_008_a_02	You're gonna get a complimentary face-beating for locking me up in that sty! <P>\n...Eh?
E0034_01_008_a_03	(CID)!
E0034_01_008_a_04	(CECIL)? You're alive! You had me worried!
E0034_01_008_a_05	I'm sorry...
E0034_01_008_a_06	Where's (ROZA)!? She went after you, convinced that you were still alive.
E0034_01_008_a_07	Golbez has taken her...
E0034_01_008_a_08	What!? How could you let that happen?<P>\nSpeaking of Golbez... First he wrecks my airships, then he takes (ROZA)!
E0034_01_008_a_09	And she's still in trouble, so stop your jabbering and take us to your airship!
E0034_01_008_a_10	Who's this snippy octogenarian?
E0034_01_008_a_11	I could say the same thing to you!
E0034_01_008_a_12	What!? I'm half your age, and then some!
E0034_01_008_a_13	Please! This is not the time. Sir, allow me to introduce the great sage (TELLA).
E0034_01_008_a_14	And this is Master (YANG), the high monk of Fabul.<P>\nI am (POLOM), an apprentice mage from Mysidia.
E0034_01_008_a_15	Great, now we'll have another geezer on board...
E0034_01_008_a_16	That repulsive brat is my twin brother, (PALOM).
E0034_01_008_a_17	You goody two-shoes!
E0034_01_008_a_18	It is an honor to meet you.
E0034_01_008_a_19	Well, you sure are a mannerly fellow.
E0034_01_008_a_20	(CID), where is your new airship?
E0034_01_008_a_21	Heh heh.
E0034_01_008_a_22	Where nobody would ever suspect.
E0034_01_008_a_23	We must hurry! (ROZA)'s life is in danger!
E0034_01_008_a_24	I know, I know! You don't have to shout, we're not deaf like you.<P>\nEveryone, follow me!
E0034_02_007_a_01	Hahahaha...<P>\nYou may have defeated me, but you have not heard the last of Cagnazzo.<P>\nNow, join me in the netherworld!
E0034_02_007_a_02	The walls!
E0034_02_007_a_03	It's locked!
E0034_02_007_a_04	This side is locked, too!
E0034_02_007_a_05	(PALOM)! (POLOM)!
E0034_02_007_a_06	I guess there's only one thing to do.
E0034_02_007_a_07	(CECIL), I'm glad we were able to become friends.
E0034_02_007_a_08	Don't do anything rash, you two!
E0034_02_007_a_09	We're not going to let you die!
E0034_02_007_a_10	We thank you for everything you taught us, Sage (TELLA).
E0034_02_007_a_11	Ready, (POLOM)?
E0034_02_007_a_12	Yes!
E0034_02_007_a_13	No!
E0034_02_007_a_14	Break!
E0034_02_007_a_15	(PALOM)!
E0034_02_007_a_16	(POLOM)!
E0034_02_007_a_17	Hold on! I know how to cure this!<P>\nEsuna!
E0034_02_007_a_18	The spell has no effect, as the twins became stone of their own will.
E0034_02_007_a_19	You fools! That was my sacrifice to make, not yours—I am an old man!
E0034_02_007_a_20	Forgive me, you two...
E0034_02_007_a_21	I will avenge you both. I swear to it!
E0034_02_007_a_22	It's time for some payback! To the Enterprise!
E0034_02_007_a_23	I'll get you...
E0034_02_007_a_24	...Golbez!
E0034_04_006_a_01	But there's nothing here.
E0034_04_006_a_02	The best place to hide is often in plain sight!
E0034_06_327_a_01	You hid it down here?
E0034_06_327_a_02	Amazing...
E0034_06_327_a_03	Ain't she a beaut? Right, let's get the Enterprise on-line!
E0034_08_323_a_01	Battle stations, everyone! Time to unleash the power of the Enterprise!
E0034_08_323_a_02	Wait!
E0034_08_323_a_03	What is that?
E0034_08_323_a_04	Looks like a white flag...
E0034_10_324_a_01	(CAIN)!
E0034_10_324_a_02	Heh! So you're still among the living.
E0034_10_324_a_03	(CAIN)! You little maggot!
E0034_10_324_a_04	Is (ROZA) safe and well?
E0034_10_324_a_05	If you want her back, bring me the Earth Crystal.
E0034_10_324_a_06	What!?
E0034_10_324_a_07	You shameless dog!
E0034_10_324_a_08	We'll speak again once you have the Crystal in your possession.<P>\nAnd if (ROZA) means anything to you, you'll get that Crystal.
E0034_10_324_a_09	Why, you...
E0034_10_324_a_10	Wake up, (CAIN)!
E0034_10_324_a_11	I have nothing else to say to you.
E0034_12_323_a_01	(CECIL)...
E0034_12_323_a_02	That dirty scumbag...
E0034_12_323_a_03	(CID), set a course northwest...for Troia.
E0044_02_015_a_01	This is...
E0044_02_015_a_02	Yes, it's your room in Baron.
E0044_02_015_a_03	Now that we've taken care of the fake king, there's nothing to worry about.
E0044_02_015_a_04	(CECIL), there's something I must tell you...
E0044_02_015_a_05	What is it?
E0044_02_015_a_06	It's about the Crystals.
E0044_02_015_a_07	Well, we've lost Troia's Earth Crystal to Golbez, which means he now holds all the Crystals.
E0044_02_015_a_08	Not quite. He only has four.
E0044_02_015_a_09	You mean there are more?
E0044_02_015_a_10	I've heard the legends, but they can't be true!
E0044_02_015_a_11	You can't mean...
E0044_02_015_a_12	They are. The Dark Crystals are real.
E0044_02_015_a_13	Makes sense. After all, our world has the Light Crystals.
E0044_02_015_a_14	So where are these Dark Crystals?
E0044_02_015_a_15	In some other world, perhaps?
E0044_02_015_a_16	Exactly. So you see, Golbez only has half of the Crystals.
E0044_02_015_a_17	Well, now we know they exist, but how do we go about finding them?
E0044_02_015_a_18	Golbez knows of their location.
E0044_02_015_a_19	Then there's no time to lose! Where are they?
E0044_02_015_a_20	They lie under the surface of the earth...in the underworld.
E0044_02_015_a_21	That cannot be!
E0044_02_015_a_22	Underground? Are you sure about this?
E0044_02_015_a_23	That's what I overheard Golbez say.<P>\nHe also said that when all of the Crystals of light and darkness are gathered, a path to the moon will open.
E0044_02_015_a_24	A path to the moon?
E0044_02_015_a_25	I'm not sure exactly what it is, but this key will help us get there.<P>\nHere, you take it.
E0044_02_015_a_26	Obtained Magma Rock.
E0044_02_015_a_27	This...is a key?
E0044_02_015_a_28	If we use it...somewhere, it should open a path to the underworld.
E0044_02_015_a_29	But where?
E0044_02_015_a_30	Yes, where do we use it?
E0044_02_015_a_31	I wish I knew...
E0044_02_015_a_32	Ah, no worries! We'll just fly around the world on the Enterprise till we find the place.
E0044_02_015_a_33	But we lost the airship near the Tower of Zot.
E0044_02_015_a_34	Pshaw! My baby's equipped with auto-pilot. I'll bet she's flown back already.
E0044_02_015_a_35	Then we have a plan.
E0044_02_015_a_36	(CID), what would we do without you?
E0044_02_015_a_37	Heh heh.<P>\nAlright, we leave first thing tomorrow. Let's rest up for our journey to the underworld!
E0044_02_015_a_38	I still don't understand... Why didn't Golbez finish me off at the tower?
E0044_02_015_a_39	(CECIL)?
E0044_02_015_a_40	Sorry, I was just thinking aloud. Come on, let's get some rest.
E0044_03_015_a_41	All set!
E0055_00_004_a_01	Hello, (CECIL). The boss ordered us to attach this hook to the Enterprise. It won't take long.
E0055_01_004_a_01	It's done! Now you can hoist and carry the hovercraft.
E0055_01_004_a_02	Just fly the Enterprise right over the hovercraft, and press Confirm to pick it up and drop it down.
E0055_01_004_a_02_2	Just fly the Enterprise right over the hovercraft, and tap the exclamation point to pick it up and drop it down.
E0055_01_004_a_03	You can go pretty much anywhere now, even the Cave of Eblan that leads to the Tower of Babel.
E0055_01_004_a_04	Simply lower the hovercraft over the shallows to board it.
E0055_01_004_a_05	There's something I must tell you both. It's about (CID)...
E0055_01_004_a_06	He's impossible. Yes, we know. With all that crazy energy, I can't imagine he'll ever check out.
E0055_01_004_a_07	I doubt anyone could put him out of commission!
E0055_01_004_a_08	We must return to work, but good luck to you all!
E0137_00_021_a_01	(CECIL)...
E0137_00_021_a_02	Your Majesty!?
E0137_00_021_a_03	Venture to the Land of Summons and return to me here. I may be able to help you then.
E0137_00_021_a_04	Yes, Your Majesty.
E0108_00_021_a_01	So you have returned.
E0108_00_021_a_02	Your Majesty...
E0108_00_021_a_03	I do not need your pity. Although I have been slain, I have been given eternal power.<P>\nThe summoner that follows you will be able to call upon me whenever my help is required.<P>\nCall on my sword, and it will be yours.<P>\nHowever, you must earn my respect by proving your strength and courage. Let us begin the battle!
E0108_00_021_b_01	Lightning courses through Odin!
E0108_01_021_a_01	You have grown strong.<P>\nNow you must use that strength to protect Baron, and the world.<P>\nI shall fight along with you as Odin.
E0108_01_021_a_02	Thank you, Your Majesty!
E0108_01_021_a_03	(RYDIA) has learned Odin.
E0135_01_022_a_01	Piggy!<P>\n!?<P>\nOops!
E0135_01_022_a_02	Aw, dang, that was Mini. Sorry!
E0136_01_020_a_01	An invisible force blocks the way.
N101_C02_004_07_01	This tower is off-limits.
N101_C02_004_03_01	All is well, sir.
N101_C02_004_03_02	I can't believe the king had been replaced by a monster...
N101_C02_004_04_01	A foreboding air surrounds the castle as of late.
N101_C02_004_04_02	We were far too negligent.
N101_C02_004_01_01	You leave early tomorrow. Please get some rest, sir.
N101_C02_004_02_01	Nightfall is approaching, sir. Please remain inside the castle.
N101_C02_004_01_02	The king forbids you from entering the castle until you have delivered the bomb ring to the village of Mist.
N101_C02_004_01_03	Leave at once! You don't have permission to be here!
N105_C01_004_06_01	Have you seen (CID)? He ordered us to service the airships, then just up and disappeared.<P>\nI think something's troubling him.
N105_C01_004_06_02	Boss! You're alive!
N105_C01_004_06_03	I guess the boss is just as busy as always!
N105_C01_004_05_01	We have to pull another all-nighter today! I'm so tired...<P>\n...Oh! Don't tell the boss that I was grousing.
N105_C01_004_05_02	Boss!? Is that you!? What are you doing here? I-I'll get back to work right away!
N105_C01_004_05_03	My skills have reached a new level. Maybe I'm ready to fill the boss's shoes now.<P>\nD-don't tell the boss I said that, okay?
N101_C02_005_01_01	I heard you acquired the Crystal from Mysidia.
N101_C02_005_01_02	The soldiers of Golbez's army were all monsters, not a single human among them.
N101_C02_005_02_01	I'm on duty! Leave me alone!
N101_C02_005_02_02	What befell the king is tragic...
N101_C02_005_03_01	You are free to take the items from the storage room to help you on your mission.<P>\nPress the switch on the wall to open the door.
N101_C02_005_03_02	I can hear the voice of the late king echoing from below. Could this castle be...haunted?
N101_C02_006_04_01	His Majesty is acting very strange lately.
N101_C02_006_04_02	Sir (CECIL) for king!
N101_C02_006_03_01	Whatever others may say, I trust the king.
N101_C02_006_03_02	We must avenge the king!
N101_C02_006_05_01	Mist Valley is northwest of Baron.
N101_C02_006_05_02	On our honor, we dragoons will protect the castle.
N101_C02_006_06_01	With you and our commander (CAIN) joining forces, nothing will be able to stop you.
N101_C02_006_06_02	I failed to protect the king. I cannot face Master (CAIN)...
P002_C00_006_07_01	I'll see you in the morn.
N003_C01_006_01_01	I've heard rather disturbing rumors regarding the king lately.
N003_C01_006_01_02	We will guard Baron with our lives, sir.
N003_C01_006_02_01	If you value your life, you'd best put king and country before anything else.
N003_C01_006_02_02	I should have acted sooner to stop the king...
N003_C01_007_01_01	The king is most displeased. He will not see you until you have delivered the bomb ring to the village of Mist.
N003_C01_008_01_01	Never again will monsters rule over this castle.
N118_C01_022_02_01	We're diligently working to develop more spells for actual combat.
N118_C01_022_02_02	How could I not see that the king had been replaced by a monster? I require much more training...
N118_C01_022_03_01	Basic spells like Fire and Blizzard aren't powerful enough to defeat many monsters.<P>\nBut I do seem to remember hearing about more potent spells...
N118_C01_022_03_02	So, Meteor exists after all!
N118_C01_022_01_01	Sleep!<P>\nHeh heh. Sweet dreams, pal!<P>\nHuh? Whazzit? You're not sleepy at all?<P>\nWell, heck, what did I do wrong?
N117_C01_023_02_01	The king is brimming with vigor these days. I find it somewhat out of character.
N117_C01_023_02_02	We will support the soldiers with our white magic.
N117_C01_023_03_01	I'm currently studying basic white magic. The four levels of Cure spells are Cure, Cura, Curaga, and Curaja.
N117_C01_023_03_02	I can't believe a monster was impersonating the king...
N117_C01_023_01_01	(ROZA) became a white mage for you, (CECIL), to help you in any way she could.<P>\nPlease don't worry her too much.
N117_C01_023_01_02	I pray that the king may rest in peace.
N101_C02_011_01_01	We've locked up the Mysidian mages who opposed us, sir. You can talk to them through the bars.
N101_C02_011_01_02	I hope we never have to lock up another soul in this prison.
N118_C01_011_02_01	You! You won't get away with this, you hear me!?
N117_C01_011_03_01	I do not expect you to spare us, but please, return the Crystal to Mysidia.
N118_C01_011_04_01	You idiots don't know anything! The Crystal isn't just any old jewel!
N101_C02_012_01_01	Owww! My arm's broken!
N101_C02_012_01_02	Captain!? I didn't recognize you!
N101_C02_012_02_01	Captain...
N101_C02_012_02_02	It's good to see you again, Captain!
N101_C02_012_03_01	We'll just eat and laugh and try to forget about Mysidia.
N101_C02_012_03_02	You are the only one who is fit to sit the throne!
N101_C02_012_05_01	I still can't believe what we did.
N101_C02_012_05_02	Golbez took command of the Red Wings!
N101_C02_012_04_01	So much for the Red Wings' honor...
N101_C02_012_04_02	If only we had some airships!
P013_C00_015_02_01	Good night.
N101_C02_016_01_01	Baron's sacred treasures rest behind this wall, but access to that chamber is forbidden.
E0006_02_352_a_01	And so, the dark knight
E0006_02_352_a_02	(CECIL) was stripped of
E0006_02_352_a_03	his command as captain of
E0006_02_352_a_04	the Red Wings. He and the
E0006_02_352_a_05	master dragoon (CAIN)
E0006_02_352_a_06	head for the foggy valley
E0006_02_352_a_07	and the village of Mist.
E0006_02_352_a_08	
E0006_02_352_a_09	The advent of the airship marked the
E0006_02_352_a_10	realization of Baron's dreams, but also
E0006_02_352_a_11	the birth of its militarism. With its
E0006_02_352_a_12	Royal Air Force, the Red Wings,
E0006_02_352_a_13	Baron soon reigned supreme.
E0006_02_352_a_14	
E0006_02_352_a_15	Now, as monsters multiply and stir
E0006_02_352_a_16	unrest, Baron only exploits its power
E0006_02_352_a_17	to collect the world's Crystals.
E0006_02_352_a_18	
E0006_02_352_a_19	
E0006_02_352_a_20	Why?
E0006_02_352_a_21	The Crystals merely shed
E0006_02_352_a_22	their light in silence...
E0032_00_025_a_01	(YANG)!
E0032_00_025_a_02	Do I know you?
E0032_00_025_a_03	It's me, (CECIL)!
E0032_00_025_a_04	(CECIL)... The traitor knight of Baron! Seize him!
E0032_00_025_a_05	Yes, sir!
E0032_01_025_a_01	(YANG)! What are you doing!?
E0032_01_025_a_02	Your treachery cannot go unpunished!
E0032_01_025_b_01	(YANG)!
E0032_01_025_b_02	Die!
E0032_01_025_b_03	It's me!
E0032_01_025_b_04	Hiyah!
E0032_01_025_b_05	Ugh...
E0032_02_025_a_01	(CECIL)! What just happened? I cannot remember anything after Leviathan attacked...
E0032_02_025_a_02	Seems you suffered a bout of amnesia and fell into Baron's hands.
E0032_02_025_a_03	You have my sincere apologies.
E0032_02_025_a_04	Where are (RYDIA) and (GILBART)?
E0032_02_025_a_05	(RYDIA) was...swallowed by Leviathan, but I do not know what became of (GILBART)...
E0032_02_025_a_06	I see...
E0032_02_025_a_07	Where are we?
E0032_02_025_a_08	In Baron. But listen, we can't talk here. Let's find somewhere away from prying ears.
E0032_02_025_a_09	Monk (YANG) has joined the party.
E0032_02_025_a_10	Thanks for taking care of those soldiers. You're more than welcome to spend the night here.
E0032_02_025_a_11	And who might this be?
E0032_02_025_a_12	(YANG), this is (TELLA). His daughter and (GILBART) were...
E0032_02_025_a_13	My daughter sacrificed herself for the man she loved.
E0032_02_025_a_14	I am sorry for your loss. I am (YANG) of Fabul.
E0032_02_025_a_15	I'm the prodigy of Mysidia! My name's (PALOM).
E0032_02_025_a_16	Feel free to ignore my twin brother. I am (POLOM).
E0032_02_025_a_17	I can't believe you fell for Baron's lies!
E0032_02_025_a_18	(PALOM)! Apologize!
E0032_02_025_a_19	No, he is right. Please, forgive my actions.
E0032_02_025_a_20	Well, first things first, we have to find (CID).
E0032_02_025_a_21	Sneaking into the castle won't be easy.
E0032_02_025_a_22	Hm? What is this?
E0032_02_025_a_23	This is the Baron key!<P>\nOf course! They must've given it to you when they gave you command of those guards.<P>\nWith this key, we should be able to enter the castle and find (CID).
E0032_02_025_a_24	Obtained the Baron key.
E0130_00_024_a_01	No, I didn't spread any rumors about the king! Really!<P>\nSay, I'll show you something neat if you promise not to get me trouble.
E0131_00_024_a_01	You used to be a dark knight, right? Wow, you look great now! Let's dance!
N999_C01_024_01_01	The door is locked.
N999_C01_024_01_02	The door has been unlocked.
N102_C01_024_01_01	You wish to go to Mist Valley? Then you must head to the cavern northwest of Baron.
N102_C01_024_01_02	Do not defy the king, or you will end up like (CID).
N102_C01_024_01_03	Sir (CECIL)! Please avenge the king!
N101_C02_024_03_01	Stay away from Mist! Leave the village alone or something bad will happen, I know it!
N101_C02_024_03_02	I saw a strange monk with some soldiers. They seemed to be looking for something.<P>\nI think they went into the inn...
N101_C02_024_03_03	What will become of Baron now? The king left no heir...
N104_C01_024_03_01	The king is gravely mistaken in ordering his men to master the dark sword.
N104_C01_024_03_02	Why is the king torturing us like this? He must have gone mad!
N104_C01_024_03_03	Are you that dark knight from before? How you've changed!
N106_C02_024_04_01	Just thinking about dark knights gives me the heebie-jeebies...but they're still pretty cool!
N106_C02_024_04_02	I wonder if that dark knight from before really died like everyone said. I liked him.
N106_C02_024_04_03	I knew it! You're Sir (CECIL)! Go beat up Golbez! Make him pay!
N105_C00_024_05_01	This door will lead to the area before Mt. Ordeals.
N105_C00_024_05_02	This door will lead to the area before the Baron Waterway.  To the right, that door will lead to the Baron Castle lobby.

N105_C00_024_05_08	This door will lead to the Bahamut Cave.

N105_C00_024_05_11	This door will lead to the Lunar Subterranne Core.
N007_C02_024_06_01	I haven't been able to dance lately because of the king's new rules. How boring!
N101_C02_026_02_01	If you're journeying far, you mustn't forget to take potions, antidotes, and tents along.
N105_C00_028_01_01	I hear the king and you boys are up to no good these days.<P>\nWhatever it is you're all doing, keep (ROZA) out of it, you hear?
N105_C00_028_01_02	Where's (ROZA)? She left Baron to look for you!
N105_C00_028_01_03	(ROZA)! Oh, thank heavens you're alright!
P003_C00_028_02_01	I'm sorry, Mother.
N105_C00_028_01_04	I never should have let you become a white mage...
P003_C00_028_02_02	I have no regrets for becoming a white mage and fighting alongside a brave knight.<P>\nIt's no different to you and Father.
N105_C00_028_01_05	...<P>\n(CECIL), please take good care of her.

E0007_00_162_a_02	Who are you!?
E0007_00_162_a_03	LEAVE NOW, OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
E0007_00_162_a_04	Show yourself!
E0007_00_162_a_05	YOU CHOOSE TO IGNORE MY WARNINGS?
E0007_00_162_a_06	We have to get to Mist! We're not turning back.
E0007_00_162_a_07	SO BE IT.
E0007_00_162_a_08	The mist is gathering!
E0007_00_162_b_01	The dragon turned into mist!
E0007_00_162_b_02	Attacking the mist is futile!
E0007_00_162_b_03	The mist will retaliate if attacked!
E0007_00_162_b_04	Attack when the dragon appears!
E0007_00_162_b_05	It's returning to its dragon form! Attack now!
E0008_00_067_a_01	You may not enter until you acquire the Bomb Ring...
E0008_00_067_a_2	What the...?
E0008_00_067_a_3	This... This is why he sent us here!?
E0008_00_067_a_4	We've destroyed the entire village...
E0008_00_067_a_5	Why would he make us do this?
E0008_00_067_a_6	Nooo! Mommy!
E0008_00_067_a_7	!?
E0008_00_067_a_8	My mom's dragon died...and because of that, my mom...my mom died too...
E0008_00_067_a_9	What!?
E0008_00_067_a_10	I've heard of people with the power to call forth monsters...<P>\nSummoners, they're called.
E0008_00_067_a_11	Then we're responsible for killing her mother by killing the dragon.
E0008_00_067_a_12	YOU killed my mom's dragon!?
E0008_00_067_a_13	We...we didn't know that would happen...
E0008_00_067_a_14	So that was the king's plan...to annihilate every summoner in this village.
E0008_00_067_a_15	That can't be...
E0008_00_067_a_16	I'm afraid it's true. I'm also afraid we're going to have to get rid of the girl.
E0008_00_067_a_17	WHAT!?
E0008_00_067_a_18	That's what the king would expect. It's her or us.
E0008_00_067_a_19	But she's just a child!
E0008_00_067_a_20	You intend to defy the king?
E0008_00_067_a_21	I refuse to carry out any more slaughter in the king's name!
E0008_00_067_a_22	...I knew you'd say that. Don't worry, I'm on your side.
E0008_00_067_a_23	You are?
E0008_00_067_a_24	I owe the king so much, but I can't disgrace the dragoons.
E0008_00_067_a_25	So you'll join me?
E0008_00_067_a_26	Yes. But we'll need the support of other nations if we're to oppose the mightiest kingdom in the land.<P>\nAnd we have to get (ROZA) out of Baron.
E0008_00_067_a_27	Thank you, (CAIN).
E0008_00_067_a_28	Save it. This isn't for your sake.
E0008_00_067_a_29	...
E0008_00_067_a_30	This place is dangerous. We'd better get going. What about the girl?
E0008_00_067_a_31	We can't leave her. We'll have to take her with us.
E0008_00_067_a_32	It's alright. We won't hurt you, but you're going to have to come with us, okay?
E0008_00_067_a_33	No!
E0008_00_067_a_34	Come on! We have to go now!
E0008_00_067_a_35	No! Go away!
E0008_00_067_a_36	Wait!
E0008_00_067_a_37	I hate you! You killed my mom!
E0008_00_067_b_01	Go awaaay!
E0008_02_067_a_01	She's safe. Thank goodness.
E0008_02_067_a_02	(CAIN)?
E0008_02_067_a_04	(CAIN)!?
E0008_02_067_a_03	I have to get her out of here. (CAIN), I pray that you're alive!

E0009_01_034_a_11	Wait!
E0009_01_034_a_12	I am here on the king's orders. All summoners from Mist must be annihilated. Hand over the girl, now!

E0009_02_034_a_07	Summoner (RYDIA) has joined the party.
E0009_02_034_a_08	All set!
E0010_00_037_a_01	(ROZA)!
E0010_00_037_a_02	(ROZA)...
E0018_00_037_a_25	(ROZA)!
E0018_00_037_a_01	(ROZA) is exposed to the light of the Sand Ruby.
E0018_00_037_a_02	...Oh!
E0018_00_037_a_03	(CECIL)!<P>\nYou're alive! Thank goodness!
E0018_00_037_a_04	How do you feel?
E0018_00_037_a_05	I'm fine. But I thought I'd lost you.<P>\nThey told me you died in Mist when the earthquake hit.
E0018_00_037_a_06	I'm sorry you had to go through that...<P>\n(ROZA), who's Golbez?
E0018_00_037_a_07	He's the new captain of the Red Wings, appointed by the king himself.<P>\nBut the king has been acting...strangely. I believe Golbez is manipulating him to collect the Crystals for himself.<P>\nWith Mysidia's Water Crystal in hand, he'll surely go after the others—the Fire Crystal of Damcyan, the Wind Crystal of Fabul, and the Earth Crystal of Troia.
E0018_00_037_a_08	The Fire Crystal has already fallen into his hands...
E0018_00_037_a_09	Ah, let me introduce you.<P>\n(GILBART) is the prince of Damcyan. (RYDIA) is a summoner from Mist.<P>\nI wouldn't have been able to get the Sand Ruby and cure your fever without their help.
E0018_00_037_a_10	Hi there.
E0018_00_037_a_11	Hello, (RYDIA). Thank you both so much.<P>\n(CECIL), after Damcyan, Fabul must be their next target. We must— *cough cough*
E0018_00_037_a_12	You have to rest now. Don't worry. We'll go to Fabul.
E0018_00_037_a_13	Sadly, the trail to Fabul is blocked by thick ice.
E0018_00_037_a_14	(RYDIA), can you cast Fire?
E0018_00_037_a_15	...No.
E0018_00_037_a_16	Fire is one of the most elementary of black magic spells. As a summoner, you...<P>\n*cough cough*
E0018_00_037_a_17	(ROZA), stop! You're in no condition to come with us!
E0018_00_037_a_18	I'll be alright, really. On my honor as a white mage, I promise I won't be a burden.
E0018_00_037_a_19	...
E0018_00_037_a_20	(ROZA) only wishes to be with you, (CECIL).
E0018_00_037_a_21	...Alright. We'll go together. Just make sure you get plenty of rest tonight.
E0018_00_037_a_22	...Thank you.
E0018_00_037_a_23	White mage (ROZA) has joined the party.
E0018_00_037_a_24	That night...

E0018_01_032_a_02	Anna, I miss you so much.
E0018_01_032_a_03	Ahhh!
E0018_01_032_b_01	(GILBART).
E0018_01_032_b_02	A-Anna!
E0018_01_032_b_03	You must fight, (GILBART).
E0018_01_032_b_04	Believe in yourself.
E0018_01_032_b_05	Anna...
E0018_01_032_b_06	Gurrrgh!
E0018_02_032_a_01	Anna!? This can't be!
E0018_02_032_a_02	I must leave this world...for a better place...
E0018_02_032_a_03	No! Don't go! I can't live without you!
E0018_02_032_a_04	You mustn't let Golbez have the Crystals. Fight for your people. Care for them as you did for me...
E0018_02_032_a_05	Yes, I'll do it! I'll fight!<P>\nBut how can I stop him? I don't know what I should do...
E0018_03_037_a_01	All set!
E0127_00_032_a_01	I want to go to Damcyan to become a dancer, but the Water Cavern is filled with monsters...<P>\nI've been practicing, though. Check out these moves!
N102_C01_032_04_01	The castle up north is Damcyan Castle, which rules over this entire desert.<P>\nI hear the Prince of Damcyan is a delicate beauty with an exquisite voice.

N114_C02_032_02_01	I heard some damsel from Baron was found passed out on the outskirts of town. She was taken to someone's house to recover.
N103_C02_032_06_01	Anna fell deeply in love with someone. But she left Kaipo because Sage (TELLA) didn't approve.
N106_C01_032_05_01	The Water Cavern is to the northeast. But it's dangerous—there have been sightings of eight water serpents recently.
N102_C02_032_01_01	This is Kaipo, the desert oasis of Damcyan.
N105_C00_034_02_01	I can't believe Anna ran away. She and her father, Sage (TELLA), are very close.
N103_C00_035_03_01	Well, hello! We rarely have visitors these days, what with all the monsters running around.
N114_C02_035_02_01	I wanna go to the Antlion Cave east of Damcyan because there's untold riches inside!<P>\nToo bad only the royals are allowed in there...
N110_C01_035_01_01	I'm a traveling scholar. I want to go to Fabul, which lies east of Damcyan, to do a little research.<P>\nBut some old man in the Water Cavern won't let me through!
N999_C03_035_01_01	Quench your thirst with Kaipo Punch!
N105_C01_037_01_01	We found a girl from Baron lying unconscious just outside of town.<P>\nThe poor thing's come down with desert fever.<P>\nShe just keeps muttering the name "(CECIL)" over and over.
N105_C01_037_01_02	You must be (CECIL). You take good care of her. She seems to care a lot about you.
N104_C02_037_02_01	To cure desert fever, you need a rare jewel called the Sand Ruby, found only in a cave where an antlion dwells.
N104_C02_037_02_02	You were only here a short while, but you've come to feel like a daughter to me. Come back anytime.
P003_C00_037_03_01	...<P>\n(CECIL)...<P>\n(CECIL), don't die on me!
N999_C02_037_04_01	Sand Ruby: The Cure for Desert Fever
E0011_00_136_a_01	Could that be...? It is! That dark sword! Dark knight, I need your assistance!
E0011_00_136_a_02	What's wrong?
E0011_00_136_a_03	I must get to Damcyan to rescue my daughter. She was deceived by a wicked bard!<P>\nWe must hurry, for I sense an ill omen!
E0011_00_136_a_04	You must be Sage (TELLA)!
E0011_00_136_a_05	Indeed I am.<P>\n...That girl! She is a summoner! Perfect! She can help too.<P>\nA giant monster lurks in the lake ahead. That devil even withstands magic.<P>\nWe can defeat it if we work together, and then I can finally be on my way!
E0011_00_136_a_06	We need to reach Damcyan as well.
E0011_00_136_a_07	Then let us make haste!
E0011_00_136_a_08	Sage (TELLA) has joined the party.
E0012_00_166_a_01	We'll rest here.
E0012_00_166_a_02	This magic field repels all monsters. You can save and use a tent or cottage in here.<P>\nLet's use my tent to rest and prepare for the upcoming battle.
E0012_01_349_a_01	The girl is asleep already. She must have been exhausted. Who is she?
E0012_01_349_a_02	A summoner from the village of Mist.
E0012_01_349_a_03	She holds great potential. With proper training, she'll be able to master many spells.<P>\nLook at her. So sweet and innocent. She reminds me of Anna at that age...
E0012_01_349_a_04	Who is Anna?
E0012_01_349_a_05	My daughter. She eloped with a bard to Damcyan because...<P>\n...I didn't consent to their union.
E0012_01_349_a_06	Tell me, what business have you in Damcyan?
E0012_01_349_a_07	A friend of mine has been struck down by desert fever...
E0012_01_349_a_08	Ah, so you seek the Sand Ruby. It won't be easy to obtain.<P>\nBut first, there's the small matter of a vicious monster that needs taking care of.<P>\nA frightful creature it is, with eight enormous tentacles. We must kill it and reach Damcyan...<P>\n...before it is too late.
E0012_01_349_a_09	Too late for what?
E0012_01_349_a_10	I don't know. I only pray my instincts are wrong...
E0012_02_166_a_01	All set!
E0080_00_169_a_01	This way leads outside. The monster lies in the cave beyond. <P>\nUse a tent outside if you must.
E0013_00_170_a_01	He's down there!
E0014_00_172_a_01	There he is!
E0014_00_172_a_02	WATCH OUT!
E0014_00_172_b_01	Excellent!
E0014_00_172_b_02	He's weakening!
E0014_01_172_a_01	Come now! Damcyan is beyond this waterfall!
P001_C00_170_02_01	The current is too strong for us to get in!
P006_C00_136_02_01	What do you think you're doing here!? This cavern is swarming with monsters!<P>\nReturn to Kaipo! Scoot!
E0016_00_041_a_01	Is that...? It is! Anna!
E0016_00_041_a_02	You! You're that bard! Anna ran away because of you!
E0016_00_041_a_03	!?
E0016_00_041_b_01	You spoony bard!
E0016_00_041_b_02	No! Wait!
E0016_00_041_b_03	Die!
E0016_00_041_b_04	P-please! Listen!
E0016_00_041_b_05	Shut up!
E0016_00_041_b_06	Forgive me! Please!
E0016_00_041_b_07	Take this!
E0016_00_041_b_08	Ouch!
E0016_00_041_b_09	Father! Stop!
E0016_01_041_a_01	Oh, Anna! I'm so glad to see you again!
E0016_01_041_a_02	Father, (GILBART) is the prince of Damcyan. Forgive me for running away...but (GILBART) and I are in love.<P>\nStill, I knew I couldn't find happiness...without your consent. I was on my way home when...
E0016_01_041_a_03	We were attacked by Baron's Red Wings and their commander, Golbez.
E0016_01_041_a_04	I've never heard of Golbez before. Who is he?
E0016_01_041_a_05	I don't know. All I know is that his strength was beyond words.
E0016_01_041_a_06	But why did they attack Damcyan?
E0016_01_041_a_07	They wanted the Crystal, and they spared no one to get it.<P>\nMy mother, my father...even Anna shielded me from their arrows.
E0016_01_041_a_08	You love him enough to give up your own life?
E0016_01_041_a_09	Father...forgive me...<P>\n(GILBART)...I love you...
E0016_01_041_a_10	Anna!
E0016_01_041_a_11	Anna!? Anna!
E0016_01_041_a_12	Damn you, Golbez!<P>\nWho is that monster, anyway!? What do you know about him!?
E0016_01_041_a_13	I hear he arrived in Baron one day and became the new leader of the Red Wings.<P>\nHe... *sob* He leads them in their mission to plunder the Crystals... *sniff*
E0016_01_041_a_14	Stop your sniveling! That will not bring Anna back!<P>\nGolbez of Baron... I shall take his life with my own two hands!
E0016_01_041_a_15	(TELLA), wait! You can't possibly go alone!
E0016_01_041_a_16	I will kill Golbez on my own.<P>\nI don't need your help. I don't need anyone's help!
E0016_01_041_a_17	(TELLA) has left the party.
E0016_01_041_a_18	Anna! *sob*
E0016_01_041_a_19	Stop crying!
E0016_01_041_a_20	You're a grownup! You're not supposed to cry!<P>\nI lost my mom, but I'm not gonna cry anymore.
E0016_01_041_a_21	(RYDIA)...
E0016_01_041_a_22	I don't care. Leave me alone!<P>\nI'm staying here with Anna. I will never leave her side.
E0016_01_041_a_23	That's enough! You're now the rightful ruler of Damcyan, so start acting like it!<P>\nYou owe it to your people, and you owe it to Anna.<P>\nYour Majesty, my name is (CECIL), and I need your help.
E0016_01_041_a_24	Why should I help you?
E0016_01_041_a_25	My friend in Kaipo is suffering from desert fever.<P>\nI need to get the Sand Ruby to save her.<P>\nCan you help me?
E0016_01_041_a_26	...What is her name?
E0016_01_041_a_27	(ROZA).
E0016_01_041_a_28	She is very dear to you, isn't she? Like Anna was to me...
E0016_01_041_a_29	You can find the Sand Ruby in the Antlion Cave, which lies to the east.<P>\nThe ruby forms from the fluid that the antlion secretes when it lays eggs.<P>\nWe can cross the shallows in my hovercraft to reach the cave.<P>\nAfter we acquire the Sand Ruby, we can cross the shallows once more to Kaipo.
E0016_01_041_a_30	Let us be on our way.
E0016_01_041_a_31	Prince (GILBART) has joined the party.
E0016_01_041_a_32	Goodbye, Anna...
N102_C02_041_06_01	We are the only survivors of Baron's attack. Perhaps we should withdraw to Kaipo.<P>\nIf only we had a hovercraft to get us across the shallows to the west...
N102_C02_041_07_01	I had planned to head across Mt. Hobs to Fabul, but the trail is blocked by a thick wall of ice.
N102_C02_042_01_01	My eyes! I can't see! Who goes there? Don't let them...take the treasure...
N102_C02_038_01_01	...
N102_C02_039_01_01	They stole...the Crystal...
N102_C02_039_02_01	The bombardment was too much...
N102_C02_040_02_01	...
N102_C02_040_03_01	The bombardment was too much...
N102_C02_040_01_01	The healing pots...upstairs... I must...
E0017_00_177_a_01	This is where the antlion lays its eggs.
E0017_00_177_a_02	Eeek!
E0017_00_177_a_03	It's okay. Antlions are quite tame. They don't attack people.<P>\nHere, I'll demonstrate by taking the Sand Ruby, like so...
E0017_00_177_a_04	Aaargh!!!
E0017_00_177_a_05	Come on! We have to help him!
E0017_01_177_a_01	Obtained the Sand Ruby.
E0017_01_177_a_02	How could this happen? They've always been totally harmless...
E0017_01_177_a_03	Monsters are growing in number of late, and their behavior is changing as well.<P>\nI can't help but feel this is some kind of sign...
E0017_01_177_a_04	Come on! Let's go cure (ROZA)!
E0017_01_177_a_05	Right! Let's go!
E0019_00_178_a_01	(RYDIA), can you try casting the Fire spell?
E0019_00_178_a_02	...
E0019_00_178_a_03	What's wrong?
E0019_00_178_a_04	Give it a try. I know you can do it.
E0019_00_178_a_05	...No.
E0019_00_178_a_06	?
E0019_00_178_a_07	I...I hate fire.
E0019_00_178_a_08	That's right... Her village was destroyed by fire when...
E0019_00_178_a_09	(RYDIA), you're the only one who can melt this ice.
E0019_00_178_a_10	...
E0019_00_178_a_11	If we don't get to Fabul, more people will be in danger.<P>\nPlease, (RYDIA). It's time to be brave!
E0019_00_178_a_12	Time to be...brave...
E0019_00_178_a_13	Please, (RYDIA)!
E0019_00_178_a_14	You must!
E0019_00_178_a_15	...
E0019_00_178_a_16	...
E0019_00_178_a_17	Fire!
E0019_00_178_a_18	(RYDIA) has learned Fire.
E0019_00_178_a_19	(RYDIA), that was incredible!
E0019_00_178_a_20	Hee hee!
E0019_00_178_a_21	I knew you could do it!
E0019_00_178_a_22	Thank you, (RYDIA).
N999_C06_178_02_01	The trail is blocked by a wall of ice.
E0020_00_180_a_01	What's going on here?
E0020_00_180_a_02	That garb... He's one of Fabul's monks.
E0020_00_180_a_03	Hyah!
E0020_00_180_a_04	Hiyah!
E0020_01_180_a_01	Good grief! That's no normal Bomb!
E0020_01_180_a_02	We have to help him!
E0020_01_180_b_01	I'M GONNA BLOW!
E0020_02_180_a_01	You have my gratitude. (YANG) is my name. I am the high monk of Fabul.<P>\nI came here to train with my men, but all were killed by a swarm of beasts...<P>\nThey were Fabul's finest monks...
E0020_02_180_a_02	My name is (CECIL). We bring urgent news to Fabul.
E0020_02_180_a_03	A villain named Golbez is using Baron's power to seize the world's Crystals for himself.
E0020_02_180_a_04	Then he covets our Wind Crystal as well.
E0020_02_180_a_05	There is no doubt. He already took the Crystal of Damcyan with ease.
E0020_02_180_a_06	Fabul may be next to fall.
E0020_02_180_a_07	Then the odds are against us—the only monks left in the castle are students.<P>\nThey stand little chance against Baron's forces.
E0020_02_180_a_08	I'd assume Golbez was behind the monster attack that killed your men...<P>\n...and almost killed you.
E0020_02_180_a_09	...Then their assault is imminent. I must go.
E0020_02_180_a_10	We will go with you to Fabul. You may need our help.
E0020_02_180_a_11	I am grateful. However, this matter does not concern you.
E0020_02_180_a_12	It concerns us all.
E0020_02_180_a_13	You see, I am the Prince of Damcyan.
E0020_02_180_a_14	(ROZA) and I are citizens of Baron, and this girl is but one victim of our kingdom's recent attacks...that I myself led.
E0020_02_180_a_15	...
E0020_02_180_a_16	I see... Then I humbly accept your assistance.
E0020_02_180_a_17	Let's go. We haven't much time.
E0020_02_180_a_18	Fabul lies to the east of these mountains.
E0020_02_180_a_19	Monk (YANG) has joined the party.
E0021_00_047_a_01	(YANG), at last you have returned.
E0021_00_047_a_02	Sire, we must prepare for battle. Baron is poised to attack and steal our Crystal.
E0021_00_047_a_03	How do you know this?
E0021_00_047_a_04	These two are citizens of Baron. They came to warn us.
E0021_00_047_a_05	And the others?
E0021_00_047_a_06	Sire, we haven't much time. The castle's defenses must be tightened immediately.
E0021_00_047_a_07	(YANG), can we trust this dark knight and his companions?
E0021_00_047_a_08	I believe so. They risked their lives to help me.
E0021_00_047_a_09	We must hurry!
E0021_00_047_a_10	Please!
E0021_00_047_a_11	It is an honor to see you again.
E0021_00_047_a_12	Prince (GILBART)!
E0021_00_047_a_13	Sire, Baron's fleet decimated Damcyan and claimed our Crystal not long ago.<P>\nMany died, including my parents and my beloved. Damcyan's tragedy must not be repeated!
E0021_00_047_a_14	I understand. Forgive my suspicions. (YANG), mobilize the men for battle.<P>\nPrince (GILBART), dark knight, will you help us to defend Fabul?
E0021_00_047_a_15	I realize I am in no position to demand anything from you...
E0021_00_047_a_16	They have already offered to help, sire. We will join the forward guards by the main gate.
E0021_00_047_a_17	Very well. Will the mages assist our medic?
E0021_00_047_a_18	Yes, sire.
E0021_00_047_a_19	Fabul's fate rests in your hands. May we be victorious.
E0021_00_047_a_20	As you command!
E0021_00_047_a_21	We will assemble at the main gate.
E0021_00_047_a_22	(CECIL)...
E0021_00_047_a_23	Come back safely.
E0021_00_047_a_24	(RYDIA), take care of (ROZA) for me.
E0021_01_044_a_01	Here they come!
E0021_01_044_a_02	Attack!
E0021_02_044_a_01	The Red Wings!
E0021_02_044_a_02	We can't hold them back!
E0021_02_044_a_03	Retreat! Into the castle!
E0021_03_045_a_01	We are severely outnumbered. I should not have let you help...
E0021_03_045_a_02	This is our fight too. And it's far from over.
E0021_03_045_a_03	Th-they're coming!
E0021_04_045_a_01	Fall back!
E0021_05_046_a_01	Isn't the throne hall just behind us!? We must hold them here!
E0021_05_046_a_02	The king has already retreated to safety with the women and children.<P>\nIt is our duty to lure the enemy away...
E0021_05_046_a_03	...and crush them!
E0021_06_046_a_01	Let's get out of here!
E0021_06_046_a_02	Damn you, Baron!
E0021_07_047_a_01	The door is bolted. We can make our last stand here!
E0021_07_047_a_02	Where is the Crystal kept?
E0021_07_047_a_03	In a vault above here.
E0021_07_047_a_04	The door has been unlocked.
E0021_07_047_a_05	You fool! What are you doing!?
E0021_07_047_a_06	H-he's one of them!
E0021_09_047_a_01	We are outnumbered! Withdraw to the vault!
E0021_09_047_a_02	Aaargh!
E0021_09_047_a_03	(GILBART)!
E0021_11_048_a_01	It's been a while.
E0021_11_048_a_02	(CAIN)! You're alive!
E0021_11_048_a_03	So it would seem.
E0021_11_048_a_04	We'll talk later. For now, we have some fighting to do.
E0021_11_048_a_05	Indeed. Are you ready to face me, (CECIL)?
E0021_11_048_a_06	What are you saying?
E0021_11_048_a_07	Ready your sword!
E0021_11_048_a_08	(CAIN)!?
E0021_11_048_a_09	Ready your sword, fool!
E0021_11_048_b_01	Why do this!?
E0021_11_048_b_02	Save your breath.
E0021_11_048_b_03	What's happened to you!?
E0021_11_048_b_04	You ask too many questions!
E0021_11_048_b_05	This is it, (CECIL).
E0021_12_048_a_01	Has Golbez poisoned your mind too?
E0021_12_048_a_02	Have you any final words?
E0021_12_048_a_03	Stop!
E0021_12_048_a_04	No!
E0021_12_048_a_05	(ROZA)!
E0021_12_048_a_06	(CAIN), you of all people...
E0021_12_048_a_07	No, I...
E0021_12_048_a_08	Why do you hesitate, (CAIN)?
E0021_12_048_a_09	Golbez!
E0021_12_048_a_10	So you're Golbez!
E0021_12_048_a_11	And you must be (CECIL).<P>\nNever hesitate to kill, (CAIN). Now, see how it is done!
E0021_12_048_a_12	(CECIL)!
E0021_12_048_a_13	No!
E0021_12_048_a_14	Silence!
E0021_12_048_a_15	(CAIN)! Get the Crystal.
E0021_12_048_a_16	Yes, sire.
E0021_12_048_a_17	(CAIN), please!
E0021_12_048_a_18	!?
E0021_12_048_a_19	(ROZA), no...
E0021_12_048_a_20	Oh? Is this woman important to you? Then I shall take her with me to raise the stakes.<P>\nUntil we meet again. Come, (CAIN)!
E0021_12_048_a_21	You won't be so lucky next time.
E0021_12_048_a_22	Wait...
E0021_12_048_a_23	Ugh...
E0021_12_048_a_24	Cure!
E0021_12_048_a_25	Feeling better?
E0021_12_048_a_26	I thank you, (RYDIA).
E0021_12_048_a_27	The Crystal is gone! I have failed!
E0021_12_048_a_28	And (ROZA) is gone too...
E0021_12_048_a_29	So we have to go help her! And get back the Crystals while we're at it!
E0021_12_048_a_30	...She's right! We have no time for moping.
E0021_12_048_a_31	(CECIL). It is our turn to assist you. But for now, let us heal our wounds.
E0021_12_048_a_32	Thank you.
E0022_00_049_a_01	Master (YANG), you may rest here tonight. Please let me know if you need anything.
E0022_00_049_a_02	So, how will we go about the rescue?
E0022_00_049_a_03	To fight Golbez, we'll need an airship. But Baron is the only kingdom that has them.
E0022_00_049_a_04	Then we must sneak into Baron and borrow one.
E0022_00_049_a_05	Baron's main force is the Red Wings, so its naval power is relatively weak.<P>\nWe might be able to slip in via a water route.
E0022_00_049_a_06	Then we need a boat.
E0022_00_049_a_07	I will ask the king for a ship tomorrow morning.
E0022_00_049_a_08	Thank you, (YANG).
E0022_00_049_a_09	By the way, who was that dragoon?
E0022_00_049_a_10	His name is (CAIN). He used to be my best friend, but he's no longer the man I knew...
E0022_00_049_a_11	Perhaps you will find your answers in Baron.
E0022_00_049_a_12	For now, we should rest.
E0022_00_049_a_13	Until tomorrow, then.
E0022_01_056_a_01	I see. I will arrange for a ship right away. (YANG), accompany (CECIL) and help him any way you can.<P>\n(CECIL), take this sword. It belonged to a dark knight who came to Fabul many years ago.<P>\nThe sword exudes tremendous force, but it is still a weapon of darkness.<P>\nDarkness can never prevail over true evil, but I have every faith that you will slay Golbez.
E0022_01_056_a_02	Received Deathbringer.
E0022_01_056_a_03	Go to the harbor to the east as soon as you are prepared. A ship awaits you there.
E0022_01_056_a_04	Golbez must be stopped. If he acquires all of the Crystals, the world will be thrust into an unprecedented crisis. I am counting on you.
E0023_00_331_a_01	Good luck y'all! Take care of yourselves and kick some backside for me!
E0023_00_331_a_02	With pleasure.
E0023_00_331_a_03	Keep your chin up, (CECIL). You'll get her back in no time!
E0023_00_331_a_04	We'll do our best.
E0023_00_331_a_05	I trust you will look after everything in my stead.
E0023_00_331_a_06	You bet. I love you, you big lunkhead!
E0023_00_331_a_07	You must be (CECIL)! I heard you smacked the hell out of those Baron lovelies. Sit back, matey, and enjoy the ride.
E0023_00_331_a_08	Anchors aweigh!
E0023_00_331_a_09	Aye-aye, Captain!
E0023_02_332_a_01	What will we do once we arrive at Baron?
E0023_02_332_a_02	We have to meet (CID), Baron's chief airship engineer. He'll help us.
E0023_02_332_a_03	I only hope the man you speak of is safe.
E0023_02_332_a_04	...
E0023_02_332_a_05	Are you cold? You're shaking.
E0023_02_332_a_06	I'm fine. It...it's nothing...
E0023_04_332_a_01	What's going on!?
E0023_06_332_a_01	Shiver me timbers!
E0023_06_332_a_02	Holy mackerel!
E0023_06_332_a_03	It's the Ruler of the Deep!
E0023_06_332_a_04	No... NO!
E0023_06_332_a_05	It's Leviathan!
E0023_08_332_a_01	Change course!
E0023_08_332_a_02	Waaah!
E0023_08_332_a_03	(RYDIA)!
E0023_08_332_a_04	(RYDIA)! (YANG)!
E0023_08_332_a_05	Argh!
E0023_08_332_a_06	(GILBART)!
E0023_10_344_a_01	...<P>\nOh... Ugh...
E0023_10_344_a_02	Where am I?
E0023_10_344_a_03	(RYDIA)!
E0023_10_344_a_04	(GILBART)!
E0023_10_344_a_05	(YANG)!
E0023_10_344_a_06	Where is everyone?
E0111_00_053_a_01	Come again? My husband's in the underworld?
E0111_00_053_a_02	Why doesn't he come home?<P>\nI'm not cryin'! I just...have somethin' in my eye...
E0111_00_053_a_03	Here, take this. Give that no-good a smack on the noggin for me!
E0111_00_053_a_04	Received Frying Pan.
E0113_00_053_a_01	Thanks for everythin'. Here, this might come in handy.
E0113_00_053_a_02	Received Knife.
E0113_00_053_a_03	Tell him not to worry about me. He should concentrate on gettin' better so he can help y'all!
E0132_00_055_a_01	You wanna see me dance?
E0132_00_055_a_02	You're no fun!
E0132_00_055_a_03	What the...?
E0132_00_055_a_04	Heeyah!
E0132_00_055_a_05	Heeyah!
E0132_00_055_a_06	Heeyah!
N011_C02_044_01_01	Master (YANG)! The king wishes to see you.
N011_C02_044_01_02	We will guard Fabul with our lives.
N011_C02_044_01_03	Greetings, sir.
N011_C02_044_01_04	It's too dangerous out there right now! You should rest for the time being.
N011_C02_045_01_01	Our best soldiers were annihilated!? Impossible!
N011_C02_045_01_02	If only we were stronger...
N011_C02_045_01_03	A strange rumor spreads amongst the sailors. They talk of the sea god's wrath...
N011_C02_045_01_04	Welcome back.
N011_C02_046_01_01	Welcome home, Master (YANG).
N011_C02_046_01_02	Please, get some rest at the inn. We will guard the castle.
N011_C02_046_01_03	Many vessels have been shipwrecked lately, but the cause has yet to be determined. Stay safe out there.
N011_C02_046_01_04	I'm happy to see you safe and sound, sir.
N104_C01_047_02_01	The king rests in his chamber. He suffered some injuries during the attack.
N011_C02_052_03_01	Golbez will pay for this!
N011_C02_052_02_01	How is Baron controlling all those monsters?
N117_C01_052_01_01	The infirmary is ready for anything.
N117_C01_052_01_02	If only my magic were as powerful as Lady (ROZA)'s...
N103_C00_053_01_01	Where have you been? Off loafin', I'll bet!
P008_C00_053_02_01	This is my wife.<P>\nDarling, (CECIL) and his companions came to my aid on Mt. Hobs.
N103_C00_053_01_02	Well, that was mighty kind of you.<P>\nHey, hon, don't you have some place you gotta be? I heard the king's waitin' for you.
N103_C00_053_01_03	Oh, hon! You're alright!
P008_C00_053_02_02	I am fine, thanks to their help.
N103_C00_053_01_04	You guys are like my hubby's guardian angels!
P008_C00_053_02_03	And you? Are you alright?
N103_C00_053_01_05	Of course! Them Baron bozos ain't never comin' back!<P>\nI gave 'em a helluva thumpin' with my non-stick frying pan!
N103_C00_053_01_06	What? Stop talkin' nonsense! My husband isn't dead! He can't be...
N011_C02_054_01_01	I heard you were attacked at Mt. Hobs! Did you sustain any injuries!?
N011_C02_054_01_02	If we had even one airship, we could at least put up some kind of fight...
N011_C02_054_01_03	I will pray for your safety.
N011_C02_054_03_01	Master! I wasn't sleeping! I...I was meditating!
N102_C01_055_03_01	Master (YANG), how did the training go?
N102_C01_055_03_02	Baron attacked with tremendous force!
N103_C00_055_02_01	With the monks to protect us, we'll be safe as long as we stay inside the castle.
N103_C00_055_02_02	Good thing our homes are within the castle walls, or else we could've lost everything in that bombing.
N106_C01_055_01_01	Master (YANG)! I hear some bad guys are coming. I hope you beat them to a pulp!
N106_C01_055_01_02	Whachooo!<P>\nI can't wait to start training. They say it's all in the mind!
N006_C01_056_01_01	Fabul has suffered much. We must regroup and protect the people.<P>\nDo not worry about me. Retire to the inn and get your rest.
N105_C01_056_02_01	This is the king's chamber.
N105_C01_056_02_02	The king was once a famous monk. There is no need to worry!
P001_C00_056_01_01	What a huge bed! I wish this was mine...
E0024_00_058_a_01	You are that dark knight from before. Why have you returned?
E0024_00_058_a_02	My name is (CECIL). I'm the former commander of the Red Wings.<P>\nAt that time, I didn't have the courage to go against the king's orders...
E0024_00_058_a_03	Words will not bring back our dead.
E0024_00_058_a_04	...
E0024_00_058_a_05	However... I see that you have changed.<P>\nPerhaps it would not be a waste of my time to hear what you have to say.
E0024_00_058_a_06	We are fighting a man named Golbez, who has somehow risen to power in Baron.<P>\nHowever, my companions and I were attacked by Leviathan on our way to rescue a friend from Golbez's clutches...
E0024_00_058_a_07	...Perhaps this is a test and you must prove yourself worthy.<P>\nHowever, you have come to rely too much on your dark sword. This will only lead to the darkening of your soul.<P>\nIf you wish to fight with purity, you must head to Mt. Ordeals to the east.<P>\nThere, you may find, is where your fate lies.
E0024_00_058_a_08	But my friends are in danger! I can't waste any time!
E0024_00_058_a_09	I see your friends mean much to you. But you must not be impatient.<P>\nYou are destined to a great fate.<P>\nYou must go to Mt. Ordeals and transform your dark sword into one of light.<P>\nThose who accept the holy light will become paladins.<P>\nMany have journeyed to Mt. Ordeals, but none have returned... Do you still wish to go?
E0024_00_058_a_10	...I feel I must.
E0024_00_058_a_11	Very well. The journey will be dangerous for a lone dark knight.<P>\nI will have two mages accompany you. (PALOM)! (POLOM)!
E0024_00_058_a_12	You called for us?
E0024_00_058_a_13	Where is (PALOM)?
E0024_00_058_a_14	(PALOM)! Come out this minute!
E0024_00_058_a_15	I can't believe I have to help this Baron scum.<P>\nBe grateful that Mysidia's prodigy, (PALOM), will assist you!
E0024_00_058_a_16	Are these the mages?
E0024_00_058_a_17	Yes. This is (PALOM) and (POLOM).<P>\nAlthough still apprentices, they should be of great help.
E0024_00_058_a_18	I'm the greatest mage in all of Mysidia! You should be thankful I'm even speaking to you!
E0024_00_058_a_19	(PALOM)! I expect you to behave yourself on this journey!
E0024_00_058_a_20	My name is (POLOM). Pleased to meet you, sir.
E0024_00_058_a_21	(PALOM)! Greet him properly!
E0024_00_058_a_22	Hey, nice to meetcha.
E0024_00_058_a_23	Black mage (PALOM) and white mage (POLOM) have joined the party.
E0024_00_058_a_24	Now, go to Mt. Ordeals. (PALOM), (POLOM), do everything in your power to assist (CECIL).
E0030_00_058_a_01	Unbelievable! You have succeeded!
E0030_00_058_a_02	Sir (CECIL) fought brilliantly.
E0030_00_058_a_03	I'll say. He passed with flying colors.
E0030_00_058_a_04	Come again?
E0030_00_058_a_05	Forgive me. I assigned them to spy on you.
E0030_00_058_a_06	That pretty much sums it up.
E0030_00_058_a_07	I feel awful having deceived you. I'm so sorry.
E0030_00_058_a_08	I suspected as much. But I deserved it, after what I did...
E0030_00_058_a_09	The most important thing is that you have become a paladin and are now free of the darkness of your past.<P>\n...That sword! Where did you obtain it?
E0030_00_058_a_10	It was given to me on the mountain's peak.
E0030_00_058_a_11	Is this...? Yes, it is!<P>\nThis sword is inscribed with the words of an ancient Mysidian legend!
E0030_00_058_a_12	A legend?
E0030_02_058_a_01	Then perhaps you can answer me this—what was the light I saw at Mt. Ordeals? "Son," it called me...
E0030_02_058_a_02	I am afraid I do not know the answer. The legend's meaning remains a mystery.<P>\nFor generations, we Mysidians have prayed for the coming of one who bears the sacred light.<P>\nPerhaps those prayers were for you.
E0030_02_058_a_03	Enough chatter! We must go and defeat Golbez!
E0030_02_058_a_04	(TELLA)?
E0030_02_058_a_05	It's been a while.
E0030_02_058_a_06	We met him on Mt. Ordeals.
E0030_02_058_a_07	And guess what? The old man learned to cast Meteor!
E0030_02_058_a_08	Meteor!? Then the seal has been broken. The world is on the brink of great change...
E0030_02_058_a_09	I care little for the world's troubles. I only wish to avenge Anna!
E0030_02_058_a_10	Anna, your daughter?
E0030_02_058_a_11	Golbez took her life, and I intend to use Meteor to take his!
E0030_02_058_a_12	(TELLA), you must not fight with hatred. Moreover, you are in no condition to use Meteor.
E0030_02_058_a_13	If I die, so be it! I will take Golbez with me!
E0030_02_058_a_14	Still stubborn as a mule, I see.
E0030_02_058_a_15	Ha! Like you're one to talk.
E0030_02_058_a_16	Nevertheless, with your spells and (CECIL)'s newfound power, you may be able to defeat Golbez.
E0030_02_058_a_17	Be that as it may, we must return to Baron to commandeer an airship first.
E0030_02_058_a_18	Very well. I shall grant you access to the Devil's Road.<P>\nAs a paladin, I am certain you can safely travel its mystical path.<P>\nNow it is time for me to retire to the Tower of Worship. I shall pray for your success.
E0030_02_058_a_19	Thank you.
E0030_02_058_a_20	(PALOM), (POLOM), return to your studies.
E0030_02_058_a_21	No fair! You told us to help any way we can! We still have a job to do!
E0030_02_058_a_22	Elder, please allow us to accompany him!
E0030_02_058_a_23	...Very well. You have both overcome the mountain's trials and returned alive.<P>\nPerhaps this is your fate. (CECIL), (TELLA), please look after them.
E0030_02_058_a_24	But, I...uh...
E0030_02_058_a_25	Are you saying you don't want us tagging along?
E0030_02_058_a_26	I'm sure we can still be of assistance.
E0030_02_058_a_27	Don't worry, old friend. I will keep an eye on them.
E0030_02_058_a_28	Then it's agreed. I'm sure we'll make a great team.
E0030_02_058_a_29	Alright!
E0030_02_058_a_30	(PALOM), this isn't going to be some kind of picnic.
E0030_02_058_a_31	The entrance to the Devil's Road is in the east of town.<P>\n(PALOM), (POLOM), please return safely. Good luck to you all.
E0068_00_057_a_01	We knew you would return. Please join us at the Tower of Worship.
E0068_02_060_a_01	Everyone, let us pray. Now is the time to make the legend come true!
E0068_04_060_a_01	Look!<P>\nOur prayers...<P>\nThey have been answered!
E0068_06_060_a_01	There is no doubt.<P>\nThat is the great and glorious vessel itself...
E0068_06_060_a_02	The Lunar Whale!
E0068_08_060_a_01	A strange voice addressed me during our prayers.<P>\nIt told me you are to fly to the moon, and that someone awaits you there.
E0068_08_060_a_02	But how can we possibly get there?
E0068_08_060_a_03	On the Lunar Whale. According to our ancient Mysidian documents, there is a Crystal inside the ship that allows navigation between here and the moon. You must communicate with it.
E0068_08_060_a_04	I'll see what I can do.
E0133_00_063_a_01	Hey! Watch this!
E0133_00_063_a_02	I'm getting sleepy...
E0133_01_057_a_01	Hee hee hee... You require much training.
E0138_00_063_a_01	My, you look exhausted. Here, drink this.
E0138_00_063_a_02	Ugh! *choke*
E0138_00_063_a_03	Har har! That was laced with poison! Die, you stupid, gullible knight!
E0152_00_057_a_01	You! I remember you! Take this!<P>\nToad!
N118_C01_057_02_01	You, become a paladin!? Ha!
N118_C01_057_02_02	I didn't know there were people in this world worthy enough to become paladins.
N118_C01_057_01_01	I have nothing to say to the likes of you!
N118_C01_057_01_02	That dark sword will be useless against the undead that infest Mt. Ordeals.
N118_C01_057_01_03	H-how did YOU become a paladin!?
N117_C01_057_04_01	The Devil's Road is like a warp in space and time. Supposedly, one must sacrifice significant vitality to cross it.
N117_C01_057_05_01	People are always hurting each other... This behavior saddens me.
N117_C01_057_05_02	You must overcome the trials of Mt. Ordeals and renounce your dark knighthood.
N117_C01_057_05_03	You must conduct yourself as befits a paladin now.
N118_C01_057_08_01	You have some gall to come here!
N118_C01_057_08_02	Many have traveled to Mt. Ordeals to seek the holy light, but none are ever seen again.
N118_C01_057_08_03	I'll never find it in my heart to forgive you!
N117_C01_057_07_01	You have no idea how much pain and suffering you have caused us...
N117_C01_057_07_02	Mt. Ordeals lies to the east.
N117_C01_057_07_03	I see you have endured much suffering yourself. I shall pray for you hereon.
N118_C01_057_06_01	Inside this building is the Devil's Road, which leads all the way to Baron. The road has been sealed since the...incident.
N117_C01_057_03_01	Ack!<P>\nYou're the dark knight from Baron!
N117_C01_057_03_02	Ack!<P>\nYou want to become a paladin?<P>\nSurely you jest!
N117_C01_057_03_03	Ack!<P>\nBut what's this?<P>\nHave you become a paladin?<P>\nGracious sakes...
N118_C01_062_01_01	What do you want? More weapons to butcher our people with?
N118_C01_062_01_02	You can't use most of the armor here unless you're a paladin. There's nothing here for you!
N118_C01_062_01_03	I told you, you can't use the armor here unless you're...a paladin...? When did you...? How...?
N999_C03_063_01_01	Never forgive! Never forget!\nDEATH TO BARON!
N118_C01_063_01_01	Please, don't kill me!
N118_C01_063_01_02	Please, don't kill me! ...What, you're going to Mt. Ordeals?
N118_C01_063_01_03	Wow, you look magnificent!
N118_C01_063_04_01	Booger off! *hiccup* I ain't afraid of ya!
N118_C01_063_04_02	You, a paladin!? Bwahahaha! *hiccup*
N118_C01_063_04_03	Dang, I've had too much. *hiccup* I coulda sworn I just saw a paladin...
N117_C01_063_03_01	You monster! Release our people!
N117_C01_063_03_02	(PALOM)! (POLOM)! Don't trust this man!
N117_C01_063_03_03	What splendor... So this is the light of a paladin!
N118_C01_063_02_01	You, a paladin? Hmph. Not a chance.
N118_C01_063_02_02	Well, I'll be hornswoggled. You did it!
N118_C01_058_04_01	We are all born innocent, yet evil souls pervade the land nonetheless.
N118_C01_058_04_02	A paladin is the antithesis of a dark knight.
N118_C01_058_04_03	So, you have become a paladin. I suppose it was your destiny.

N999_C02_058_05_01	Fire, Earth, Water, Wind: Origin of All
N118_C01_058_03_01	The elder said we should forgive and forget your terrible acts...yet I cannot.
N118_C01_058_03_02	You will receive my trust once you become a paladin.
N118_C01_058_03_03	Hereafter, you have my complete trust.
N117_C01_058_02_01	You are in the Manor of Prayers. You may talk to the elder, if you wish.
N117_C01_058_02_02	You must go and test yourself to see if you are worthy to receive the holy light.
N117_C01_058_02_03	Freed from darkness, you now shine as brilliantly as the sun!
N004_C01_060_01_01	I believe you hold the key to our fate. All I can do is pray.<P>\n(PALOM), (POLOM), listen carefully to the words of (CECIL) and assist him on his journey.
N004_C01_060_01_02	...I see. (PALOM), (POLOM)... I am proud of them both.
N004_C01_060_01_03	(TELLA)...  So he fought with hatred after all... I pray that he may rest in peace.
N004_C01_060_01_04	You must return to the moon and face your destiny.
N118_C01_060_03_01	The elder has been praying here more than ever recently.
N118_C01_060_03_02	Please hurry to the moon.
N117_C01_060_02_01	We pray for the souls of all living creatures.
N117_C01_060_02_02	We shall continue to pray.
P009_C00_060_20_01	Good luck! I sure wish we could join you...
P010_C00_060_18_01	You've become a truly great paladin! I had faith in you all along.
P008_C00_060_17_01	Destiny has chosen you for the final battle. We shall pray for you.
P007_C00_060_19_01	I have faith in you, and I know (TELLA) would too. I will pray for you on his behalf!
N010_C00_060_12_01	I never imagined this to happen...
N010_C00_060_13_01	(GILBART) has been constantly praying for your safety.
N030_C00_060_14_01	Please come back and visit us again, okay?
N015_C00_060_15_01	The fate of the land and every living being rests in your hands.
N005_C01_060_10_01	(CECIL), please return safely!
N005_C01_060_11_01	The boss sure is in a cranky mood when you're not around, (CECIL). Please come back safe.
P005_C00_060_16_01	Hell, I wanna go with you guys! *sigh*<P>\nYou'd better come back alive, or else I'll kill ya!
E0025_00_182_a_01	Well, what are you waiting for?
E0025_00_182_a_02	Yeah, yeah. Keep your hat on!
E0025_00_182_a_03	Blizzard!
E0025_00_182_a_04	Ha! Too easy!
E0025_00_182_a_05	*whack*
E0025_00_182_a_06	(PALOM)! The elder taught us not to submit to arrogance!
E0025_00_182_a_07	Please, forgive his antics.
E0025_00_182_a_08	Meanwhile...
E0026_00_183_a_01	(TELLA)!
E0026_00_183_a_02	(CECIL)?
E0026_00_183_a_03	What brings you here? Wait...you seek Meteor as well?
E0026_00_183_a_04	Meteor?
E0026_00_183_a_05	If you know about Meteor...
E0026_00_183_a_06	That means you're (TELLA)! Hey, old man, am I right?
E0026_00_183_a_07	Don't be rude! You stand before the great sage himself!
E0026_00_183_a_08	It is an honor to meet you. We came here from Mysidia on the orders of our elder.
E0026_00_183_a_09	Yeah, we're spying on—
E0026_00_183_a_10	*whack*
E0026_00_183_a_11	...Please excuse him. As I was saying, we're serving as guides for Sir (CECIL). My name is (POLOM).
E0026_00_183_a_12	And I'm (PALOM), Mysidia's most exalted mage! I've heard a lot about you!
E0026_00_183_a_13	Kids from Mysidia, eh? But where are (RYDIA) and (GILBART)?
E0026_00_183_a_14	We were attacked by Leviathan on our way to Baron, and...
E0026_00_183_a_15	What? They aren't dead, are they!?
E0026_00_183_a_16	I can't say for sure, but I fear the worst... On top of that, Golbez has captured (ROZA).
E0026_00_183_a_17	I'll betcha that's his girlfriend!
E0026_00_183_a_18	Hush!
E0026_00_183_a_19	I thought you'd headed straight to Baron to confront Golbez.
E0026_00_183_a_20	My magic still lacks the power to defeat him, so I came here to find the legendary spell, Meteor.<P>\nI sense a strong aura on this mountain. I believe it holds what I am looking for.
E0026_00_183_a_21	But that spell is much too dangerous! It requires tremendous vitality. For a man your age...
E0026_00_183_a_22	I admit I am old, but one old man's life is a fair price to pay to bring down Golbez!
E0026_00_183_a_23	...
E0026_00_183_a_24	Geez. Why are adults so pigheaded?
E0026_00_183_a_25	You don't understand because you're still a kid! Now hush!
E0026_00_183_a_26	(CECIL), you have yet to answer my question. Why did you come here?
E0026_00_183_a_27	I came here in hopes of becoming a paladin.<P>\nI cannot defeat Golbez with the dark sword...and I have longed to renounce this hateful thing.
E0026_00_183_a_28	Who's Golbez?
E0026_00_183_a_29	Don't you know anything!? He's the one controlling Baron!
E0026_00_183_a_30	He is no ordinary man, but a powerful sorcerer whose evil grows by the second.
E0026_00_183_a_31	So, (CECIL), you are here to become a paladin?<P>\nThen this mountain must hold some secret after all. I shall accompany you.
E0026_00_183_a_32	Sage (TELLA) has joined the party.
E0156_00_185_a_01	Sssrrr...
E0156_00_185_a_02	(PALOM), stop that!
E0156_00_185_a_03	Stop what?
E0157_00_185_a_01	Sssrrr...
E0157_00_185_a_02	I said, stop it!
E0157_00_185_a_03	It's not me!
E0027_00_185_a_01	Sssrrr...
E0027_00_185_a_02	I sense an evil presence.
E0027_00_185_a_03	I will enjoy...killing you all.
E0027_00_185_a_04	Who's there!?
E0027_00_185_a_05	Under Master Golbez's orders...I, Scarmiglione of Earth, will deliver you...unto the gates of hell.<P>\nMy undead hunger...for your flesh!
E0027_00_185_b_01	Tear them apart!
E0027_00_185_b_02	What's happening to me!?
E0028_00_185_a_01	Sssrrr... Fools. My true strength lies in death. Join me in hell!
E0028_00_185_b_01	This is my true form.
E0028_00_185_b_02	Die!
E0028_00_185_b_03	Breathe deep, and walk as the undead!
E0028_01_185_a_01	H-how could I possibly lose?
E0028_01_185_a_02	Ugh... Gahhh!
E0029_00_185_a_01	My son...
E0029_00_185_a_02	Son!? Just who are you?
E0029_01_350_a_01	Long have I awaited you, and much sorrow have I endured.<P>\nI shall now entrust you with my strength.<P>\nIn doing so, my pain will only grow, but there is no other way...
E0029_01_350_a_02	Break from your past and overcome the darkness. Only then will you receive the holy power.<P>\nYou must defeat the dark knight within you!
E0029_01_350_a_03	!?
E0029_01_350_a_04	What's going on!?
E0029_01_350_a_05	There are two of them!
E0029_01_350_a_06	(CECIL)!
E0029_01_350_a_07	Hey!
E0029_01_350_a_08	Look out!
E0029_01_350_a_09	Stay back! This is my battle, one I must fight alone to atone for my wrongs.
E0029_01_350_b_01	A true paladin...
E0029_01_350_b_02	...would sheathe his sword.
E0029_01_350_b_03	There is more at stake...
E0029_01_350_b_04	...than justice or truth.
E0029_01_350_b_05	One day, you will see.
E0029_01_350_b_06	Now go! Seek what you must!
E0029_02_350_a_01	You have done well... Now my spirit will become light, and that light will be your strength.<P>\nWith it, you must stop Golbez. Farewell, my son.
E0029_02_350_a_02	No! Don't go!
E0029_02_350_a_03	(CECIL) has become a paladin.
E0029_02_350_a_04	Are you alright?
E0029_02_350_a_05	You must be...
E0029_02_350_a_06	(PALOM)! Enough!
E0029_02_350_a_07	This feeling... I can't explain it. It feels...so familiar. And that voice...
E0029_02_350_a_08	...Oh my!
E0029_02_350_a_09	Mister (TELLA)?
E0029_02_350_a_10	My spells! I remember them now!
E0029_02_350_a_11	(TELLA) remembered all of his spells.
E0029_02_350_a_12	!?<P>\nMe...teor...?<P>\nThat light! Somehow, it broke the seal upon Meteor!
E0029_02_350_a_13	(TELLA) has learned Meteor.
E0029_02_350_a_14	He is indeed a great sage.
E0029_02_350_a_15	Hey, (POLOM)... I think it's time we...
E0029_02_350_a_16	Er, (CECIL)?
E0029_02_350_a_17	We have to tell you something. We're actually—
E0029_02_350_a_18	I am ready to face Golbez! I am doom itself!
E0029_02_350_a_19	Come, (CECIL)! To Baron!
E0029_02_350_a_20	Yes...to Baron.
E0029_02_350_a_21	That light... Why did it call me "Son"?
E0029_02_350_a_22	Hey, wait up!
E0029_02_350_a_23	Are you coming?
E0029_02_350_a_24	...Yes.
E0134_00_072_a_01	Did you come to check out our dance routine?<P>\nYou won't be wasting your time!
E0134_00_073_a_02	Hey there, we're the Mythril Brothers! Are you ready to get your groove on? Let's do it!
E0134_00_073_a_03	Yeah!
N122_C01_072_01_01	A human visitor, eh? Make sure you watch your step. Don't tromp on me, please.
N122_C02_072_03_01	Hoity-toity! Are you all giants?
N120_C03_072_04_01	I can't imagine how much you have to eat to fill up a body as big as yours.
N120_C03_072_05_01	Mythril Mountain lies far to the north. Although with your long legs, getting there will take you much less time than it takes us!
N002_C00_072_02_01	Mr. Frog, Mr. Little, and I work to gather, refine, and forge mythril into armor and weapons.
N122_C02_072_06_01	Awesome!
N120_C03_072_08_01	Served!
N122_C01_075_02_01	I'm the prettiest girl in this village!<P>\nI'm so small that you can't tell? Then come get a closer look!
N122_C02_075_03_01	Having a beautiful daughter isn't easy, I tell you. I have to protect her from all the scum out there!
E0128_00_093_a_01	Welcome! The show will begin in a few minutes. Would you like to watch?
E0139_00_091_a_01	May I see your membership pass, please?
E0139_00_091_a_02	Thank you. Please enjoy the show!
N103_C02_086_01_01	Welcome to Troia, the city where trees and water abound!
N104_C00_086_02_01	Shoo!<P>\nGo find your own place!
N109_C02_086_03_01	Oh, for Pete's sake... Why are you swimming in your armor? It'll rust!
N109_C01_086_04_01	Would you like to join us for a swim?
N105_C01_086_05_01	Have you seen my husband? Where is that wrinkly old codger!?
N114_C02_086_06_01	I took a silver strongbox to the northeast cavern, but it got stuck to the ground and I had to leave it behind.
N026_C00_086_07_01	...<P>\nGo away! Can't you see I'm sunbathing!?
N107_C01_086_09_01	Have you heard of the Twin Harp? I hear you can transmit your voice really far with it.
N105_C00_094_01_01	Thanks to the ample water supply here, we can grow fresh vegetables and even raise chocobos.
N999_C02_094_03_01	Chocobo Physiology
N999_C02_094_04_01	Zen and the Art of Chocobo Raising
N106_C02_095_02_01	I want to fly on a black chocobo, but I don't think they like me... They freak out when I try to get close.
N107_C01_095_01_01	Chocobos are real cute! They smell a little, though.
N105_C00_095_03_01	These black chocobos can't fly for some reason.\n<P>\nThe ones living in the Chocobo Village to the north can, but only at low altitudes.<P>\nThough I hear those chocobos can only land in forests.
N103_C02_095_04_01	Black chocobos can remember the way home, but they tend to run away after making a round trip.
N999_C03_095_01_01	-The Troia Tattler-<P>\nNew Breed of Chocobo Discovered! Amazing "black chocobos" set to revolutionize transportation!
N116_C01_095_05_01	Kweh, kweh.
N102_C01_091_08_01	Stellaaa!<P>\nYou're so beautiful!<P>\n...What!?<P>\n...You're a man!?
N109_C02_091_07_01	Hey there, cutie! Chat with me for a while!
N109_C01_091_02_01	The air here's fresh, the food tastes great... I love this place!
N105_C00_091_09_01	I'll take good care of you.<P>\n...What's with that look? You gotta problem with me!?
N104_C00_091_04_01	Live a long life, I say. I'll take this place over heaven any day!
N102_C02_091_06_01	Yes! I finally got a good seat at the counter!
N114_C01_091_05_01	The ladies here always put a smile on my face!
N103_C00_091_10_01	Give me a holler if you want something!
N102_C02_092_01_01	I hope you carry a fat wallet, mister. It's all high rollers from here on, if you know what I mean.
N105_C00_092_02_01	Shoo! You don't belong here.
N109_C02_092_03_01	Bring me a fur coat next time, okay, sweetie?
N104_C00_092_04_01	I'll buy you anything you want!
N103_C00_092_05_01	I have to make sure everyone gets what they ordered!
N104_C02_092_07_01	...And then I thrust my blade into the goblin and offed him once and for all!
N109_C01_092_08_01	That geezer keeps babbling about all his stupid adventures... If I have to hear one more story...
N105_C00_092_09_01	That old geezer better not mess with my Jenny!
N104_C00_093_02_01	Haven't you got better things to do than hang out here?
N109_C02_093_03_01	EEEK!<P>\nGet out of here, you pervert! This is the dressing room!
E0035_00_100_a_01	(GILBART)!
E0035_00_100_a_02	(CECIL)? You're alive... I'm so relieved. I wish to join you again.
E0035_00_100_a_03	In that condition? You'd only be a burden!
E0035_00_100_a_04	(TELLA)... I can't begin to ask for your forgiveness.<P>\nAnna died because of me...
E0035_00_100_a_05	...
E0035_00_100_a_06	I can never atone for that.
E0035_00_100_a_07	(GILBART), your health should be your greatest concern now. You must try and rest.
E0035_00_100_a_08	(YANG)... So you survived... And (RYDIA)?
E0035_00_100_a_09	...
E0035_00_100_a_10	...I see. That is terrible news.<P>\nI always seem to find myself elsewhere when others are in need...
E0035_00_100_a_11	Hey, I heard you took mighty good care of (CECIL) and (ROZA)! I appreciate it!<P>\nWhy don't you join us on my Enterprise? Together we'll rise above anything!
E0035_00_100_a_12	You must be (CID), the airship engineer.<P>\n...Wait! Does this mean we have an airship!?
E0035_00_100_a_13	...Oh! But (CECIL), why is (ROZA) not with you!?
E0035_00_100_a_14	Golbez holds her captive, but he proposed a trade. He will release (ROZA) in return for Troia's Crystal.<P>\nBut the Crystal lies in the hands of the Dark Elf...
E0035_00_100_a_15	The Dark Elf...
E0035_00_100_a_16	(CECIL), you must take this.
E0035_00_100_a_17	What is it?
E0035_00_100_a_18	This is the only way I can be of any help right now.
E0035_00_100_a_19	Received Twin Harp.
E0035_00_100_a_20	(CECIL), please save (ROZA).
E0081_01_100_a_01	(CECIL)...is in danger... They're all in danger!
E0081_01_100_a_02	You're in no condition to go anywhere!
E0081_01_100_a_03	Where are you going!?
E0081_01_100_a_04	To get...my harp... Ugh!
E0081_01_100_a_05	You can barely sit up! Please, lie down and get some rest!
E0081_01_100_a_06	I don't care...what happens to me...<P>\nI'm the only one...who can save them!
E0038_00_100_a_01	You have returned.
E0038_00_100_a_02	Thank you for your help, (GILBART).
E0038_00_100_a_03	There is no need to thank me.
E0038_00_100_a_04	What I don't understand is how that worked...
E0038_00_100_a_05	I first heard that melody back when I traveled as a minstrel.<P>\nI recall it being a song to ward off elves and I thought it might work...
E0038_00_100_a_06	We owe you our lives.
E0038_00_100_a_07	No, I only... Ugh!
E0038_00_100_a_08	(GILBART)!
E0038_00_100_a_09	(TELLA), I...
E0038_00_100_a_10	I have long wondered what Anna saw in you. But now I think I understand.<P>\nYou showed courage and integrity. She was fortunate to have your love.
E0038_00_100_a_11	...
E0038_00_100_a_12	Now be silent and heal your wounds. I promise you I shall avenge Anna for the both of us.
E0038_00_100_a_13	Thank you...
E0038_00_100_a_14	(GILBART), I look forward to fighting alongside you again.
E0038_00_100_a_15	...Anna, now I think I understand why you did what you did.
E0039_00_098_a_01	Go to the Tower Of Zot?
E0039_00_098_a_02	You may not enter until you have the Earth Crystal.
E0039_00_098_a_03	I can take you to the Tower of Zot... if you have the Earth Crystal...
E0039_00_098_a_04	Hurrah!
E0039_00_098_a_05	I see you have the Earth Crystal.
E0039_00_098_a_06	That voice!
E0039_00_098_a_07	(CAIN)!
E0039_00_098_a_08	Board my ship and bring the Crystal with you. I will take you to (ROZA).
E0040_01_320_a_01	Where is the Earth Crystal?
E0040_01_320_a_02	I have it here. Where's (ROZA)?
E0040_01_320_a_03	In the Tower of Zot. Now, come aboard.
N101_C02_096_01_01	Welcome to Troia Castle.
N101_C02_096_02_01	Please, make yourselves at home.
N101_C02_096_03_01	You wish to know about the Crystal? Speak to the clerics inside the castle.
N101_C02_096_04_01	The clerics are solemn servants of the gods. Honor them and conduct yourselves properly, understood?
N120_C03_096_08_01	Ribbit!
N120_C03_096_06_01	Ribbit!
N120_C03_096_05_01	...
N101_C02_097_01_01	A Damcyan man recently drifted into Troia. He claims he's a prince.
N101_C02_097_02_01	Troia has never been at war. I don't know how well we could defend our kingdom if fighting did break out...
N101_C02_097_03_01	I hear Baron is becoming more and more aggressive. I hope they don't attack us.
N101_C02_097_04_01	Unlike most kingdoms, Troia is governed by women, and all our soldiers are female.
N105_C00_097_07_01	The clerics are convening in the chamber over there.
N101_C02_097_05_01	You want me to dance for you? As if! I'm a guard, not a dancer!
N101_C02_097_06_01	This armor lacks strength, but affords excellent mobility. It's also very fashionable!
N109_C02_104_01_01	This was once a dungeon, but it now houses Troia's treasures.
N109_C02_104_01_02	Have the clerics granted you permission to enter?
N109_C02_104_01_03	I admire your honesty.
N109_C02_104_01_04	Don't lie to me!
N109_C02_104_01_05	Go right ahead.
N101_C02_100_01_01	Please keep your voice down. There's a sick man resting here.
N102_C02_100_02_01	We are attending to the prince around the clock. Me? I'm the nurse. She's the doctor.
N103_C01_100_03_01	He requires much rest. He is quite frail, and his recovery will not be a quick one.
P007_C00_100_04_01	(CECIL), you must save (ROZA)!
P007_C00_100_04_02	Please take care.
P007_C00_100_04_03	(TELLA) is...!? No... Why!?
P007_C00_100_04_04	(YANG)... If only I were stronger...
P007_C00_100_04_05	(YANG) is alright? Thank heavens... Have you told his wife the good news?
N999_C07_100_03_01	It's (GILBART)'s harp.
N101_C02_098_01_01	The eight clerics are sisters.
N101_C02_098_02_01	Women make far more civilized rulers than men.
N010_C00_098_03_01	We don't know what to do. The Dark Elf stole our Earth Crystal!
N010_C00_098_03_02	The nature of the Crystal's power changes depending on the bearer.<P>\nIf it fell into the wrong hands, who knows what could happen.
N010_C00_098_03_03	I hear that more than four Crystals may exist. If that is the case, we still have hope!
N010_C00_098_04_01	We have governed Troia for years with the blessing of the Earth Crystal, but now...
N010_C00_098_04_02	What is going on!?
N010_C00_098_04_03	How horrible! Not only Troia, but the whole world is in danger!
N010_C00_098_05_01	Equipping anything metallic inside the northeast cavern will hamper your movement.
N010_C00_098_05_02	We just got the Crystal back, but I guess we have no choice. It's only a loan, though!
N010_C00_098_05_03	The Crystals were divided between the four kingdoms to prevent them being gathered together.
N010_C00_098_06_01	We will consider lending you the Earth Crystal if you can reclaim it.
N010_C00_098_06_02	What was that voice?
N010_C00_098_06_03	Whoever gathers all of the Crystals will be able to gain tremendous powers.
N010_C00_098_07_01	If you're looking for the Dark Elf, try the cavern on the island to the northeast.
N010_C00_098_07_02	That voice!? What was it?
N010_C00_098_07_03	The Crystal has been taken? You must hurry and retrieve it!
N010_C00_098_08_01	If you can recover the Crystal, we will allow you to borrow it. Please speak to us once you obtain it.
N010_C00_098_08_02	Feel free to take the items in the underground storeroom.
N010_C00_098_08_03	Now that Golbez controls all the Crystals, the entire world is at risk.
N010_C00_098_09_01	Without the Crystal, Troia might become a wasteland once more!
N010_C00_098_09_02	It seems you need our help. You may borrow the Crystal as promised.
N010_C00_098_09_03	Really!? The Crystal was taken!? Oh no!
N010_C00_098_10_01	The Dark Elf is weak against metallic weapons. He has set up a magnetic field around his lair for protection.
N010_C00_098_10_02	We are letting you borrow the Crystal, so be extra careful with it!
N010_C00_098_10_03	How could the Crystals fall into the wrong hands!?
E0036_01_192_a_01	That magnetic field is powerful! Equipping anything metallic will slow us down.
E0036_01_192_a_02	My claws appear to be unaffected.
E0036_01_192_a_03	Magnetic field is in effect.
E0081_00_201_a_01	I comMEND your efFORT, but your excurSION ends here. You will nevER get the crysTAL.<P>You canNOT deFEAT me with those weaPONS.
E0081_00_201_a_02	We shall see about that.
E0081_00_201_a_03	Let's see how he likes my magic spells!
E0081_00_201_b_01	Fool!
E0081_00_201_b_02	Can you withSTAND this?
E0081_00_201_b_03	We stand...no chance...
E0081_00_201_b_04	I need my sword.
E0081_00_201_b_05	Ugh...
E0081_00_201_b_06	Say your praYERS!
E0081_00_201_a_04	If only I could use my sword...
E0081_02_201_a_01	The Twin Harp sounds the melody from (GILBART)'s harp.
E0081_02_201_a_02	Hm?
E0081_02_201_a_03	That melody...
E0081_02_201_a_04	It's (GILBART)!
E0081_02_201_a_05	GAH! What is this torturOUS sound?
E0081_02_201_a_06	He cannot control the magnetic field while I am playing!<P>\nNow! Draw your sword!
E0081_02_201_a_07	Right!
E0037_00_201_a_01	You... GAAAH!
E0037_00_201_a_02	This canNOT be! With the CrysTAL... my eterNAL life...<P>\nGaaaAH!
E0037_00_201_a_03	Thank you, (GILBART).
E0037_00_201_a_04	Obtained Earth Crystal.
E0025_00_209_a_01	Come forth, Scarmiglione!
E0025_00_209_a_02	Scarmiglione of Earth, at your command.
E0025_00_209_a_03	(CECIL) aspires too much. He ascends Mt. Ordeals as we speak.<P>\nI shall clip his wings now.
E0025_00_209_a_04	So he desires to become a paladin...
E0025_00_209_a_05	Dispose of him. His dark sword should be all but useless against your undead.
E0025_00_209_a_06	I shall return with his head.
E0025_00_209_a_07	Make sure that you do.
E0025_00_209_a_08	Yes, sir.
E0025_00_209_a_09	This is getting interesting, wouldn't you say, (CAIN)?
E0025_00_209_a_10	(CECIL) might still prove to be quite a formidable opponent.
E0025_00_209_a_11	You dare question my judgment?<P>\nScarmiglione is one of the four Elemental Lords. He will not fail.<P>\n(ROZA) and I will delight in watching (CECIL)'s demise.
E0025_00_209_a_12	Sire, please grant me a second chance!<P>\nInstead of Scarmiglione, allow me the task of slaying him!
E0025_00_209_a_13	Just be grateful I let you live after your little blunder.
E0025_00_209_a_14	...
E0025_00_209_a_15	(CECIL)...
E0034_00_209_a_01	He defeated Cagnazzo. His power continues to grow.
E0034_00_209_a_02	Sire, regarding the last Crystal...
E0034_00_209_a_03	I know. That place remains a problem.
E0034_00_209_a_04	Then how about we have (CECIL) get it for us?
E0034_00_209_a_05	Hmm...
E0034_00_209_a_06	I'm certain he will comply. After all, we have (ROZA).<P>\nWe can exchange her for the last Crystal.
E0034_00_209_a_07	A primitive idea, but it just might work. And I will destroy him at the time of exchange.
E0034_00_209_a_08	I shall convey your terms to him.
E0034_00_209_a_09	(CAIN)!
E0034_00_209_a_10	(ROZA), you'll see soon enough that I am superior to (CECIL).
E0040_00_202_a_01	(CAIN)!
E0040_00_202_a_02	Where are you hiding!?
E0040_00_202_a_03	Now, now. Master Golbez would like a word with you.
E0040_00_202_a_04	Golbez!
E0040_00_202_a_05	Well done, (CECIL). You have exceeded even my expectations.
E0040_00_202_a_06	Wretch! Show yourself!
E0040_00_202_a_07	In due time. You will yet come to understand my benevolence.
E0040_00_202_a_08	What benevolence?
E0040_00_202_a_09	(ROZA) stands beside me at the top of this tower.<P>\nBring the Crystal here, and we will make the trade.
E0040_00_202_a_10	She had better be safe!
E0040_00_202_a_11	Then you had best hurry. We wouldn't want anything...unfortunate to happen to her.
E0041_00_206_a_01	Welcome to the Tower of Zot!
E0041_00_206_a_02	Charmed, I'm sure.
E0041_00_206_a_03	Welcome! We are the Magus Sisters. We serve Barbariccia, Lord of Wind.
E0041_00_206_a_04	Mindy!
E0041_00_206_a_05	Sandy!
E0041_00_206_a_06	Cindy!
E0041_00_206_a_07	We're afraid your journey is over.
E0041_00_206_a_08	We will take your Crystal.
E0041_00_206_a_09	Say goodbye to your beloved (ROZA).<P>\nDelta Attack!
E0041_00_206_b_01	Ready, Sis?
E0041_00_206_b_02	Cast the spell, Mindy.
E0041_00_206_b_03	Okay. Reflect this!
E0041_00_206_b_04	Delta Attack!
E0041_01_206_a_01	This can't be!
E0041_01_206_a_02	Our Delta Attack failed!?
E0041_01_206_a_03	Nooo!
E0042_00_208_a_01	Welcome.
E0042_00_208_a_02	Golbez!
E0042_00_208_a_03	Where's (ROZA)!?
E0042_00_208_a_04	First, the Crystal.
E0042_00_208_a_05	She'd better be alright!
E0042_00_208_a_06	Hand over the Crystal now or she dies.
E0042_00_208_a_07	Here, take it!
E0042_00_208_a_08	Handed over the Earth Crystal.
E0042_00_208_a_09	There. Now where's (ROZA)?
E0042_00_208_a_10	(ROZA)? Whomever are you talking about?
E0042_00_208_a_11	What!?
E0042_00_208_a_12	You double-crossing cur!
E0042_00_208_a_13	Return her this minute!
E0042_00_208_a_14	Ignorant dotard. Have you no idea whom you are dealing with?
E0042_00_208_a_15	How could I forget the monster who killed my daughter!?
E0042_00_208_a_16	Vengeance will be mine!
E0042_00_208_b_01	Such feeble spells rather befit...
E0042_00_208_b_02	...the decrepit old fool you are!
E0042_00_208_b_03	I must cast Meteor.
E0042_00_208_b_04	No!
E0042_00_208_b_05	It will destroy you!
E0042_00_208_b_06	I have no choice.
E0042_00_208_b_07	Witness my ultimate spell!
E0042_00_208_b_08	I-impossible!
E0042_01_208_a_01	Ugh... How could he know Meteor?
E0042_01_208_a_02	(TELLA)!
E0042_01_208_a_03	It matters not. The Crystal is mine. (CAIN)!
E0042_01_208_a_04	...
E0042_01_208_a_05	So Meteor broke my spell over him. So be it. He no longer serves any purpose.<P>\nMark my words, (CECIL). Someday, I will destroy you.
E0042_01_208_a_06	Golbez!
E0042_01_208_a_07	Impudent fool!
E0042_01_208_a_08	!?
E0042_01_208_a_09	Ugh... Why don't...you finish me?
E0042_01_208_a_10	You...
E0042_01_208_a_11	?
E0042_01_208_a_12	What is going on? Ugh... Aaagh!
E0042_01_208_a_13	!?
E0042_01_208_a_14	We will settle this the next time we meet!
E0042_01_208_a_15	(CECIL)!
E0042_01_208_a_16	Are you okay?
E0042_01_208_a_17	Yes... Meteor must have weakened him.<P>\n(TELLA)! Are you hurt!?
E0042_01_208_a_18	I...failed...
E0042_01_208_a_19	Keep still!
E0042_01_208_a_20	I'm such a fool... I lost myself...in my own hatred. Avenge my daughter...for me...<P>\nI beg of you...
E0042_01_208_a_21	(TELLA)!
E0042_01_208_a_22	No!
E0042_01_208_a_23	......
E0042_01_208_a_24	Get up, you old geezer!
E0042_01_208_a_25	......
E0042_01_208_a_26	(TELLA)...
E0042_01_208_a_27	...I'll bet your daughter's mighty proud of you. You did good, old man.
E0042_01_208_a_28	(TELLA), Anna... I swear on my life...to avenge you both!
E0043_00_208_a_01	(CAIN)! (CAIN)!
E0043_00_208_a_02	(CECIL)... I... I'm so sorry... What have I done?
E0043_00_208_a_03	Don't blame yourself. You had no control over your actions.
E0043_00_208_a_04	But...a part of me was still awake, and yet I just stood by and watched as (ROZA)...
E0043_00_208_a_05	(ROZA)! Where is she!?
E0043_00_208_a_06	Beyond those doors! We must hurry!
E0043_00_208_a_07	(CECIL)!
E0043_00_208_a_08	(ROZA)...
E0043_00_208_a_09	I knew you'd come.
E0043_00_208_a_10	I missed you so much... And I realized...
E0043_00_208_a_11	(CECIL)...
E0043_00_208_a_12	...
E0043_00_208_a_13	You realized what!? Spit it out!
E0043_00_208_a_14	Wait, is that (CAIN)?
E0043_00_208_a_15	Don't worry, he's back to normal.<P>\n(TELLA)'s Meteor broke Golbez's spell.
E0043_00_208_a_16	Forgive me (ROZA). I was not completely under Golbez's control...<P>\nI tried my best to keep you close at any cost!
E0043_00_208_a_17	(CAIN)...
E0043_00_208_a_18	...
E0043_00_208_a_19	...
E0043_00_208_a_20	Let's fight together, (CAIN).
E0043_00_208_a_21	After all that I've done... I don't deserve the honor.
E0043_00_208_a_22	...
E0043_00_208_a_23	Hey! Save the corny drama for later! We gotta scram!
E0043_00_208_a_24	Let's go, (CAIN).
E0043_00_208_a_25	...
E0043_00_208_a_26	We need your help now more than ever.
E0043_00_208_a_27	(CECIL)... (ROZA)... Thank you.
E0043_00_208_a_28	White mage (ROZA) and dragoon (CAIN) have joined the party.
E0044_00_209_a_01	Hahahaha!
E0044_00_209_a_02	It seems Master Golbez has underestimated you.
E0044_00_209_a_03	The Lord of Wind, Barbariccia!
E0044_00_209_a_04	You disappoint me, (CAIN). Falling back in with such weaklings, despite your powers.
E0044_00_209_a_05	I've simply come to my senses.<P>\nI've grown sick of siding with animals like you!
E0044_00_209_a_06	You snotty little wretch. I'll enjoy killing every one of you!<P>\nWith the old man and his Meteor gone, you stand no chance.
E0044_00_209_a_07	Let's see about that.
E0044_00_209_b_01	Violent winds inhibit regular attacks!
E0044_00_209_b_02	Only jump attacks will work!
E0044_01_209_a_01	It's not over... The last Elemental Lord still remains!<P>\nRegardless, you'll never leave here alive!
E0044_01_209_a_02	Hahahaha!
E0044_01_209_a_03	The tower's collapsing!
E0044_01_209_a_04	Dammit!
E0044_01_209_a_05	That cur!
E0044_01_209_a_06	Hold on to me!
E0044_01_209_a_07	Teleport!
N999_C01_208_03_01	The door is locked.
P013_C00_209_02_01	That sure was close.
E0045_00_109_a_01	It sure looks deep.
E0045_00_109_a_02	Wh-what in the world...?
N109_C00_110_10_01	Let me dance for you! I will show you how our ancestors danced in the underworld!<P>\nFeast your eyes!
N102_C01_106_01_01	This is Agart. The people here all share the same lineage—our ancestors were dwarves.
N103_C00_106_03_01	According to a famous saying, there are two sides to everything, even this world...
N107_C01_106_05_01	I'm strong! My grandpa's grandpa's grandpa was really strong too!
N105_C01_106_02_01	We cannot live without the blessing of the sun, although our ancestors might disagree.
N106_C02_106_06_01	Maybe I'm short because my ancestors were dwarves. I wish they were ogres... Then I'd be really tall!
N104_C00_106_07_01	What? You want to know how our ancestors came here? Well, it's a funny story... Um...<P>\nDarn, I seem to have forgotten the tale...
N114_C00_106_04_01	Behind this door lies a sacred well that has been here for generations. No one knows how deep it goes.
N103_C02_107_01_01	My husband's a real swot. He even forgets to eat when he's in his observatory.
N110_C01_107_02_01	Welcome to Corio's Observatory. We possess perhaps the best telescope in the world.<P>\nWe've recently noticed some anomalous activity on the moon.
N999_C02_107_03_01	The Romantic Night Sky
N999_C02_107_02_01	Constellations and their Origins
N999_C02_107_01_01	Phases of the Moons
N110_C00_108_01_01	I'm Corio. I study the two moons, one of which has been exhibiting some strange behavior of late.<P>\nOne moon has no sign of activity, but the other has traces of life, and is turning a reddish color...<P>\nA color similar to that of blood... I have an inescapable sense sense of foreboding...
N114_C01_110_01_01	Supposedly, our ancestors came from the other world. Their world also has a sun, called "Magma."
N102_C02_110_02_01	The other day, I saw a reddish mass get swallowed up by the northern crater!
N103_C02_110_04_01	It's so peaceful here in Agart, though we do have the occasional earthquake.
N107_C02_110_06_01	Without darkness, light cannot exist. Without day, there can be no night.<P>\nThese are the laws of nature. These are the words of our ancestors.
N106_C01_110_07_01	My grandma is the oldest person in the village. She knows everything!
N104_C00_110_08_01	Legend says our ancestors came out of the crater of the mountain to the north.<P>\nThe crater is sealed now, but I don't suppose it matters—you need an airship to get there anyway.
N105_C02_110_09_01	We have an old saying in this town. It goes:<P>\n"When the shining stone is returned, the path home will be revealed."
E0046_01_02_a_01	!?
E0046_01_02_a_02	The Red Wings!
E0046_03_02_a_01	How did they beat us here?
E0046_03_02_a_02	And who are they fighting?
E0046_03_02_a_03	I'm gonna bust through the line! Hang on!
E0046_03_02_a_04	She won't hold together!
E0046_03_02_a_05	We're going down!
E0046_03_02_a_06	(CECIL)!
E0046_04_02_a_01	(ROZA)!
E0046_04_02_a_02	Is everyone alright?
E0046_04_02_a_03	Yeah... But the Enterprise... We have to land. It's too risky to fly in this condition.
E0046_04_02_a_04	We have no choice. Let's take her down.
E0047_00_120_a_01	Welcome.
E0047_00_120_a_02	You are?
E0047_00_120_a_03	I am King Giott, ruler of the underworld. State your business.
E0047_00_120_a_04	We've come in search of the Dark Crystals.
E0047_00_120_a_05	Ah, I see. Same as the others. But from what I have witnessed, I gather you are not on their side.
E0047_00_120_a_06	Please, tell me you still have the Dark Crystals.
E0047_00_120_a_07	Unfortunately, they have stripped us of two. Now only two remain in our possession.
E0047_00_120_a_08	We were a fraction too late...
E0047_00_120_a_09	The castle's Crystal is still safe. Our tanks fought them off.
E0047_00_120_a_10	So those were your tanks we saw battling the airships on our way here.
E0047_00_120_a_11	Airships, you call them? You overworlders create many incredible wonders. <P>\nOur tanks have taken quite a beating. Can you help us with your airship?
E0047_00_120_a_12	We'd love to, but she got busted up real good in the crossfire before. I need to repair her first.
E0047_00_120_a_13	We will do anything in our power to help you repair your airship.
E0047_00_120_a_14	Ahh, she won't last in the heat of this magma, anyway. I'll fix her as best I can for now.<P>\nBut I need to fly back up to the surface and gather some mythril to armor her better.
E0047_00_120_a_15	(CID)!
E0047_00_120_a_16	Just button up and relax. I'll be back before you know it!
E0047_00_120_a_17	Be careful, (CID).
E0047_00_120_a_18	Heh heh. No worries! I'm a tough old man!
E0047_00_120_a_19	(CID) has left the party.
E0047_00_120_a_20	King Giott, where is the Crystal?
E0047_00_120_a_21	In the safest place in the castle... Hidden behind my throne.
E0047_00_120_a_22	!
E0047_00_120_a_23	(YANG)? What's wrong?
E0047_00_120_a_24	Someone is spying on us.
E0047_00_120_a_25	What?
E0047_00_120_a_26	Perhaps it was your imagination.
E0047_00_120_a_27	I wish it were so...but I definitely sense a presence.
E0047_00_120_a_28	Open the door!
E0047_00_120_a_29	Yes, sire!
E0047_01_339_a_01	It's locked!
E0047_01_339_a_02	Yip-ho-ho!
E0047_01_339_a_03	?
E0047_01_339_a_04	Dolls?
E0047_01_339_a_05	Guess who?<P>\nYup, Calcobrenas!
E0047_01_339_a_06	We're cute!
E0047_01_339_a_07	And we're scary!
E0047_01_339_a_08	We love to kill!
E0047_01_339_a_09	Let's take their heads!<P>\nYeah!
E0047_01_339_a_10	A gift for Golbez!
E0047_01_339_a_11	Yippy ho!
E0047_01_339_b_01	Combine!
E0047_01_339_b_02	Power shortage! Disengage!
E0047_02_339_a_01	Owww!
E0047_02_339_a_02	You big bullies!
E0047_02_339_a_03	But now Golbez knows about this place!
E0047_02_339_a_04	He's gonna getcha!
E0047_02_339_a_05	Sir Golbez!
E0047_02_339_a_06	!?
E0047_02_339_a_07	Our paths cross again...
E0047_02_339_a_08	Golbez!
E0047_02_339_a_09	I commend you for finding your way to the underworld.<P>\nTo reward your efforts, I shall tell you why I am collecting the Crystals.<P>\nI require all eight in order to reactivate the Tower of Babel, which leads to the moon.<P>\nLegends say a power beyond our comprehension can be found there.<P>\nI need only one more Crystal to turn my dream into reality.<P>\nYou have been of great aid to my quest. Now prepare for your final reward!
E0047_02_339_b_01	Heh heh heh... Your power pales in comparison to mine...
E0047_02_339_b_02	I expected more.
E0047_02_339_b_03	Open your eyes...
E0047_02_339_b_04	...and gaze upon true terror.
E0047_02_339_b_05	Shadow, come forth!
E0047_02_339_b_06	Farewell, (CECIL).
E0047_02_339_b_07	My Shadow Dragon...
E0047_02_339_b_08	...destroyed by mist?
E0047_02_339_b_09	Are you okay? You should be able to move now.
E0047_02_339_b_10	That voice...
E0047_02_339_b_11	This cannot...this cannot be...
E0047_04_339_a_01	We did it... We defeated Golbez!
E0047_04_339_a_02	(RYDIA)!
E0047_04_339_a_03	You look so...different. What happened to you?
E0047_04_339_a_04	Leviathan took me to the Land of Summons.
E0047_04_339_a_05	What's that?
E0047_04_339_a_06	It's the world of the monsters I can summon.<P>\nWe became friends during my stay. I learned a lot there.<P>\nI can't use white magic anymore, but I've grown strong as a summoner.<P>\nTime flows differently there, so I may have aged quite a bit.
E0047_04_339_a_07	I'll say! You're all grown up.
E0047_04_339_a_08	(CECIL), who is she?
E0047_04_339_a_09	It's the girl we found in Mist.
E0047_04_339_a_10	She survived!?
E0047_04_339_a_11	Fortune favors us indeed.
E0047_04_339_a_12	(RYDIA), we owe you our lives. Thank you.
E0047_04_339_a_13	You don't have to thank me. The queen of the Land of Summons said to me that a great force is secretly at work, and we must confront it together.
E0047_04_339_a_14	And so we shall!
E0047_04_339_a_15	Summoner (RYDIA) has joined the party.
E0047_04_339_a_16	I...cannot perish!
E0047_04_339_a_17	The Crystal!
E0047_05_120_a_1	Forgive me. Golbez has taken the Crystal.
E0047_05_120_a_2	One Crystal left... We must protect it at all costs.
E0047_05_120_a_3	Yes. Where can we find it?
E0047_05_120_a_4	In the Sealed Cavern to the southwest, where Golbez is no doubt heading.<P>\nDo not worry. He cannot enter without the key. <P>\nI have a request.
E0047_05_120_a_5	We will do anything. It was our fault the Crystal was stolen...
E0047_05_120_a_6	I want you to retrieve the seven Crystals from the Tower of Babel.
E0047_05_120_a_7	That won't be easy.
E0047_05_120_a_8	I presume it will be fortified.
E0047_05_120_a_9	Do not worry! I have a plan. You will sneak in and seize the Crystals while our tanks distract them.<P>\nThe plan must be executed immediately, before Golbez returns from the Sealed Cavern.
E0047_05_120_a_10	What do you think?
E0047_05_120_a_11	A large force might be waiting.
E0047_05_120_a_12	It's a risk.
E0047_05_120_a_13	Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
E0047_05_120_a_14	As His Majesty says, now might be our only chance.
E0047_05_120_a_15	Alright.
E0047_05_120_a_16	We'll go to the tower and reclaim the Crystals.
E0060_00_120_a_01	You have returned!
E0060_00_120_a_02	Were you able to recover the Crystals?
E0060_00_120_a_03	No, I'm sorry.
E0060_00_120_a_04	I see. Golbez is very persistent. He is trying to open the Sealed Cavern by force.<P>\nIt will only be a matter of time before he succeeds. I want you to get the Crystal before he does.<P>\nLuca, come here.
E0060_00_120_a_05	Yes?
E0060_00_120_a_06	Your necklace.
E0060_00_120_a_07	Here.
E0060_00_120_a_08	This is the key to open the Sealed Cavern. With this necklace, the entrance will allow you to pass.<P>\nWe must protect the last Crystal.
E0060_00_120_a_09	We'll do our best.
E0060_00_120_a_10	Received Luca's necklace.
E0061_00_126_a_01	Hey, where's my food?
E0061_00_126_a_02	(CID)!
E0061_00_126_a_03	I can't believe it!
E0061_00_126_a_04	How did you...?
E0061_00_126_a_05	Heh heh.
E0061_00_126_a_06	Who's this geezer?
E0061_00_126_a_07	Geezer!? Who's this snot-nosed kid!?
E0061_00_126_a_08	Watch your mouth, windbag!
E0061_00_126_a_09	You got a name to go with that yap of yours, runt?
E0061_00_126_a_10	You're speaking to (EDGE), Prince of Eblan!
E0061_00_126_a_11	It's hard to believe, but it's true.
E0061_00_126_a_12	I'm also handsome and really skilled!
E0061_00_126_a_13	Stop that! He's in no condition to be antagonized by you!
E0061_00_126_a_14	Heh heh. (RYDIA)'s got you whipped, eh, kid?
E0061_00_126_a_15	Shut up! Geez!
E0061_00_126_a_16	So, what of Golbez?
E0061_00_126_a_17	He still holds all of the Crystals except one.
E0061_00_126_a_18	But we can't go after the last Crystal, since we left the Enterprise at the surface.
E0061_00_126_a_19	We've taken an enemy airship, but it can't fly over the magma.
E0061_00_126_a_20	I guess it's time for me to shine again! What would you do without me, eh?
E0061_00_126_a_21	Back to bed!
E0061_00_126_a_22	Wait till you heal!
E0061_00_126_a_23	Ahh, can it and give me a hand!
E0061_00_126_a_24	I think he's fine.
E0061_00_126_a_25	Yeah...
E0061_02_126_a_01	Now you can fly over anything.
E0061_02_126_a_02	Thank you!
E0061_02_126_a_03	...
E0061_02_126_a_04	(CID)!?
E0061_02_126_a_05	Zzz...
E0061_02_126_a_06	He must be pooped.
E0061_02_126_a_07	He's overworked himself again.
E0061_02_126_a_08	Thanks, (CID).
E0066_00_120_a_01	You have returned! Where is the Crystal?
E0066_00_120_a_02	The truth is...
E0066_00_120_a_03	You did not succeed in retrieving it? So Golbez holds all the Crystals. There is nothing we can do now...<P>\nThat is, unless the legend of the Lunar Whale is true...
E0066_00_120_a_04	The Lunar Whale?
E0066_00_120_a_05	A huge ship spoken of in legend. "One born of a dragon..."
E0066_00_120_a_06	The Mysidian legend!
E0066_00_120_a_07	You know of Mysidia?
E0066_00_120_a_08	It's the home of the mages in the overworld.
E0066_00_120_a_09	Mysidia truly exists!?
E0066_00_120_a_10	I've met the elder of Mysidia before. He prays tirelessly in a tower.
E0066_00_120_a_11	He prays, you say?
E0066_00_120_a_12	Yes... Why do you ask?
E0066_00_120_a_13	Perhaps he prays for the Lunar Whale! You must hurry to Mysidia!
E0066_00_120_a_14	But the way to the surface is sealed off.
E0066_00_120_a_15	We can't get near the Tower of Babel, either.
E0066_00_120_a_16	Then dig your way out.
E0066_00_120_a_17	(CID)!
E0066_00_120_a_18	I'll attach a drill to the Falcon's bow.
E0066_00_120_a_19	Shouldn't you be in bed?
E0066_00_120_a_20	Naw, no worries.
E0066_00_120_a_21	Are you sure you're up to it?
E0066_00_120_a_22	Easier'n falling off a bike!
E0066_00_120_a_23	Okay! Let's get to work!
E0066_01_347_a_01	(CID)!
E0066_02_126_a_01	(CID)...
E0066_02_126_a_02	You really should have stayed in bed...
E0066_02_126_a_03	I guess I need to step away from the action for a while.<P>\nOther than messing with airships, I'm not much use anymore.
E0066_02_126_a_04	My hat's off to you, old man. You're really something.
E0066_02_126_a_05	Get well, okay?
E0066_02_126_a_06	Look after (CECIL) and (ROZA).
E0066_02_126_a_07	Don't worry. Just get some rest.
E0066_02_126_a_08	Take care of yourselves, you hear?
E0066_02_126_a_09	You too.
E0066_02_126_a_10	Alright. Get outta here.
E0066_02_126_a_11	Thanks for everything.
E0129_00_133_a_01	I can take you to the big Zeromus fight!  Are you interested?
E0129_00_133_a_02	Bleh! I've danced myself dizzy... Lali-heuuurgh... I'm really sick...
N112_C01_118_01_01	Lali-ho!
N112_C01_118_02_02	This is the dwarven castle. King Giott rules here.
N112_C01_118_03_03	Golbez is evil! ...But you don't look evil.
N112_C01_118_04_04	Go see King Giott.
N030_C00_119_05_01	I'm Luca. My dolls disappeared. Have you seen them?
N112_C01_119_01_01	Lali-ho!
N112_C01_119_02_01	King Giott is waiting.
N112_C01_119_08_01	Lali-ho! No entry! This room is off-limits!
N112_C01_119_03_01	Lali-ho is the dwarven greeting!
N112_C01_119_04_01	Say it with me!<P>\nOne, two, three!<P>\nLALI-HO!
N112_C02_119_06_01	I'm a nurse. And no, I'm not a man!
N112_C02_119_07_01	When the hole to the overworld caved in, it was total chaos down here!<P>\nI helped out an old kook who got injured. He's sleeping in the infirmary as we speak.
N112_C01_121_04_01	Lali-ho! No entry! This room is off-limits!
N112_C01_121_06_01	Lali-ho! No entry! This room is off-limits!
N112_C01_121_01_01	Dwarven items hold magical powers! Humans can't handle them!
N112_C01_129_01_01	Dwarven weapons are heavy! Too heavy for humans!
N112_C01_129_02_01	Dwarven armor is thick! Too thick for humans to move in!
N112_C01_125_01_01	Fat Chocobo? Insolent fool! That's the bird of the gods you're talking about!
N112_C01_125_02_01	The Great One can be entrusted with things you don't need or can't use right away.
N112_C01_125_03_01	You have permission from the king? Then you may enter!
N112_C01_127_01_01	Lali-ho!
N112_C01_127_03_01	Take care!
N112_C01_127_02_01	There are gigantic cannons in the Tower of Babel!
N112_C01_127_04_01	The monsters in the underworld are fearsome. Be careful!
N112_C01_128_01_01	I'm brave! But that's nothing compared to how brave you are!
N112_C01_128_04_01	He who fights and runs away lives to see another day!
N112_C01_128_03_01	Come back in one piece!
N112_C01_128_02_01	Rubicante, the strongest of the four Elemental Lords, is at the Tower of Babel!
N112_C01_128_05_01	You sneak into the tower while we distract them with our tanks!
N112_C01_128_06_01	Inside this pot is the Water of Life! Drink some before you go!
N112_C02_126_01_01	This is the infirmary!
N112_C02_126_01_02	That kook is old, but he's really lively!
N112_C02_126_01_03	That kook is rowdy, but he's really nice!
N112_C02_126_01_04	That kook is amazing! He attached the drill!
N112_C02_126_04_01	I'm getting better!
N112_C02_126_03_01	Zzz...
N112_C02_126_02_01	We dwarves are tough! But even we get hurt once in a while.
N112_C02_126_02_02	That kook is a greedy pig! He complains a lot about the food, but he still eats a ton!
N112_C02_126_02_03	That kook is crazy! He needs rest.
N112_C02_126_02_04	Overworlders sure work hard. I'm impressed!
P005_C00_126_03_ 01	Zzz... Zzz...
P005_C00_126_03_ 02	You'll be fine. With my airship, nothing can go wrong!
N015_C00_120_01_01	There is an exit in the castle's basement.<P>\nYou may leave when you are ready. Good luck.
N030_C00_120_02_02	How dare they use my dolls for something like that!
N112_C02_120_05_01	Lali-ho! Think you can remember that?
N112_C02_120_03_01	We have tanks for defense! We won't go down easily!
N112_C02_120_04_01	The underworld is a swell place to live! Stay here with us!
N112_C02_120_06_01	The king showers Luca with affection so she won't feel lonely without her mother.
N015_C00_120_01_03	We will hold off the enemy. You head southwest to the Sealed Cavern.
N030_C00_120_02_03	That necklace belonged to my mother.
N112_C02_120_05_02	I heard you can get to the Land of Summons from the underworld, if you can find the right cave.
N112_C02_120_06_02	You can't fly over magma? Where is that airship fellow? Can't he help?
N112_C02_120_03_02	Dwarves can't fly, but you can! The Sealed Cavern should be your next stop!
N112_C02_120_04_02	Dwarves also live in Tomra, near the Sealed Cavern.<P>\nBut the river of magma keeps us from going there...
N015_C00_120_01_04	Go to Mysidia! May the wind be at your back.
N030_C00_120_02_04	Please visit us again.
N112_C02_123_01_01	You're fighting Golbez too? Take the treasure upstairs! I hope it helps!
N112_C02_131_01_01	King Giott wants you to put our treasures to good use!
N112_C01_118_05_01	All's well!
N112_C01_118_06_01	All's well over here!
N112_C01_118_07_01	Golbez has retreated!
N112_C01_118_08_01	Is the overworld full of evil?
N999_C03_133_02_01	1991\nDev Team Office (Abandoned)
E0051_00_225_a_01	Have a safe trip, Master Rubicante.
E0051_00_225_a_02	Do not worry about me. Eblan has already been decimated along with its ninjas.<P>\nTake care of things until I return.
E0051_00_225_a_03	Heh heh! Golbez and Rubicante are gone! I'm in charge now!
E0051_00_225_a_04	What's with him?
E0051_00_225_a_05	Shhh!
E0051_00_225_a_06	Who's there!?
E0051_00_225_a_07	!
E0051_00_225_a_08	(CECIL)! How did you get up here!?
E0051_00_225_a_09	Caught you at a bad time, eh? What a pity Rubicante isn't around to protect you!
E0051_00_225_a_10	How dare you disrespect me, fool!<P>\nI may not be an Elemental Lord, but I, Dr. Lugae, am the brains of Golbez's operation!<P>\nOn my honor, I will protect this tower!
E0051_00_225_a_11	That's a laugh!
E0051_00_225_a_12	I've heard enough out of you! My greatest creation will shut you up soon enough!
E0051_00_225_b_01	Barnabas, attack!
E0051_00_225_b_02	Grrr!
E0051_00_225_b_03	Yeow! You big oaf!
E0051_00_225_b_04	Over there! Beat them up, not me!
E0051_00_225_b_05	Show no mercy!
E0051_00_225_b_06	Oil... OILLL...
E0051_00_225_b_07	You need more oil!
E0051_00_225_b_08	My baby! You hurt my baby!
E0051_00_225_b_09	You've left me no choice!
E0051_00_225_b_10	I'll control him myself!
E0051_01_225_b_11	No more games!
E0051_01_225_b_12	Transform!
E0051_01_225_b_13	Hmm... What's this button do?
E0051_01_225_a_01	How dare you!? I'll show you why I'm feared!
E0051_02_225_a_01	You're too late.<P>\nThe Tower of Babel connects the underworld and the overworld, and Rubicante has already taken all the Crystals to the surface.<P>\nThe dwarves will be annihilated with my cannons! Victory is mine! Mwahahaha!
E0051_02_225_a_02	The dwarves are in danger!
E0051_02_225_a_03	We have to stop the cannons!
E0051_02_225_a_04	What are we waiting for? Let's go!
E0052_00_221_a_01	Hahaha! Killing dwarves is fun!
E0052_00_221_a_02	You cowards!
E0052_00_221_a_03	You!
E0052_00_221_a_04	How did you get in here!?
E0052_00_221_a_05	Kill them!
E0052_01_221_a_01	Ugh... D-destroy the controls!
E0052_01_221_a_02	Nothing can stop the cannons now!
E0052_01_221_a_03	!
E0052_01_221_a_04	Dammit!
E0052_01_221_a_05	(YANG)!
E0052_01_221_a_06	What are you doing!?
E0052_01_221_a_07	Leave this to me! Go! Get out of here!
E0052_01_221_a_08	No!
E0052_01_221_a_09	It's going to explode!
E0052_01_221_a_10	Go now!
E0052_02_221_a_01	(YANG)!
E0052_02_221_a_02	(CECIL), everyone, thank you for the memories.
E0052_02_221_a_03	Open the door!
E0052_02_221_a_04	(YANG)!
E0052_02_221_a_05	Please don't do this!
E0052_02_221_a_06	There must be another way!
E0052_02_221_a_07	Tell my wife...I will always be with her.
E0052_02_221_a_08	(YANG)!!!
E0052_02_221_a_09	Farewell.
E0052_02_221_a_10	(YANG)!
P013_C00_225_02_01	It's some kind of warp system. But it doesn't look like we can use it.
N999_C01_221_01_01	The door is locked.
N999_C01_221_01_02	The door has been unlocked.
N999_C01_221_01_03	The door is broken.
E0053_00_210_a_01	You never cease to amuse me...
E0053_00_210_a_02	Golbez!
E0053_00_210_a_03	When the cat is away, the mice will play.<P>\nBut the game ends now.
E0053_02_346_a_1	Whoa! Doesn't get closer than that!
E0053_02_346_a_2	(CID)!
E0053_02_346_a_3	Where's (YANG)?
E0053_02_346_a_4	He...
E0053_02_346_a_5	He was a hero till the very end.
E0053_02_346_a_6	So we've lost another good man...
E0053_02_346_a_7	*sob sob*
E0053_02_346_a_8	And who's she?
E0053_02_346_a_9	This is (RYDIA). She's a summoner from Mist.
E0053_02_346_a_10	Damn! They're still on me!
E0053_04_346_a_01	Can we lose them!?
E0053_04_346_a_02	I don't know. The Red Wings' fleet seems to have been upgraded!
E0053_06_346_a_01	They're catching up!
E0053_06_346_a_02	Come on, baby, you can do it!
E0053_08_346_a_1	The engine's not gonna last! (CECIL), take over!
E0053_08_346_a_2	(CID)!
E0053_08_346_a_3	Where are you going!?
E0053_08_346_a_4	Once the Enterprise flies outta here to the surface, I'm gonna seal the entrance with this bomb!
E0053_08_346_a_5	Wait!
E0053_08_346_a_6	Oh yeah, head on back to Baron afterward and get in touch with my men.<P>\n(CECIL), take good care of (ROZA). Treat her well!
E0053_08_346_a_7	Stop! There has to be another way!
E0053_08_346_a_8	(CID), please don't!
E0053_08_346_a_9	Hey, that's Uncle (CID) to you!
E0053_08_346_a_10	Remember—head for Baron immediately!
E0053_09_346_a_01	Now this is what I call going out with a bang! Haw haw haw!
E0053_11_346_a_01	(CID)...
E0053_11_346_a_02	...Why?
E0053_11_346_a_03	Everyone chooses death too hastily...
E0053_11_346_a_04	Let's head to Baron.
E0083_00_234_a_01	How do we get in?
E0083_00_234_a_02	Heh heh. Watch this.
E0083_00_234_a_03	Ready?
E0056_ 00_239_a_01	(EDGE)...
E0056_ 00_239_a_02	Father! Mother!
E0056_ 00_239_a_03	Thank heavens... You're alright...
E0056_ 00_239_a_04	You're...alive?
E0056_ 00_239_a_05	Come with us, (EDGE)...
E0056_ 00_239_a_06	Yes... Come with us...
E0056_ 00_239_a_07	Where will we go?
E0056_ 00_239_a_08	TO HELL!
E0056_ 00_239_a_09	!!!
E0056_ 00_239_b_01	Fools...
E0056_ 00_239_b_02	Burn to ashes!
E0056_ 00_239_b_03	What's going on!?
E0056_ 00_239_b_04	Father! Mother!
E0056_ 00_239_b_05	It's me, (EDGE)! Your son!
E0056_ 00_239_b_06	The king and queen break free from the spell!
E0056_ 00_239_b_07	(EDGE)...
E0056_ 00_239_b_08	We are no longer human...
E0056_ 00_239_b_09	We no longer belong here...
E0056_ 00_239_b_10	I'm sorry, (EDGE)...
E0056_ 00_239_b_11	...
E0056_ 00_239_b_12	We must go now...
E0056_ 00_239_b_13	Eblan lies in good hands...
E0056_ 00_239_b_14	Serve our people well...
E0056_ 00_239_b_15	Don't leave me!
E0056_ 00_239_b_16	Farewell, my son...
E0056_ 00_239_b_17	Mother!
E0056_ 00_239_b_18	Don't go!
E0056_ 01_239_a_01	...
E0056_ 01_239_a_02	(EDGE)...
E0056_ 01_239_a_03	Lugae... He overstepped his bounds this time...
E0056_ 01_239_a_04	Rubicante! You twisted devil!
E0056_ 01_239_a_05	I am sorry for your loss, but it was Lugae who turned your parents into monsters.<P>\nMy only wish is to battle you fairly.
E0056_ 01_239_a_06	To hell with your self-righteous blabbering!
E0056_ 01_239_a_07	I admire your spirit.<P>\nBut anger can never draw out one's true strength—it blinds you to what you truly need to see.
E0056_ 01_239_a_08	Shut up! I'll show you the power of rage!
E0056_ 01_239_a_09	Anger evoked (EDGE)'s dormant powers.
E0056_ 01_239_a_10	(EDGE) has learned Flood and Blitz.
E0056_ 01_239_a_11	Well, this is interesting. Still, nothing can penetrate my Cloak of Flame, not even ice!
E0057_00_239_a_01	I shall restore you to full strength. Do not disappoint me!
E0057_00_239_a_02	HP and MP restored.
E0057_00_239_b_01	Poor technique.
E0057_00_239_b_02	This is how it's done.
E0057_00_239_b_03	Well fought.
E0057_00_239_b_04	But this is not the end.
E0057_00_239_b_05	I shall rise again.
E0057_01_239_a_01	Even the weak become strong when they work together. I am most impressed.<P>\nUntil we meet again...
E0057_01_239_a_02	...<P>\nFather...<P>\nMother...<P>\nYou can rest in peace now.
E0057_01_239_a_03	Your Highness!
E0057_01_239_a_04	Gramps!
E0057_01_239_a_05	Pray, let us fight with you! Where is that devil, Rubicante!?
E0057_01_239_a_06	We got him. It's over.
E0057_01_239_a_07	Splendid!
E0057_01_239_a_08	These people helped me out.
E0057_01_239_a_09	Oh my! It's you!
E0057_01_239_a_10	So, who's this Golbez?
E0057_01_239_a_11	Rubicante's master. He plans to gather the Crystals so he can reach the moon.
E0057_01_239_a_12	Why the moon?
E0057_01_239_a_13	We don't know exactly.<P>\nWe think he seeks some great power that's hidden there.
E0057_01_239_a_14	We have to stop him!
E0057_01_239_a_15	So he's the evil mastermind behind all this...<P>\nI'm going with you.
E0057_01_239_a_16	But, Your Highness, Eblan needs you.
E0057_01_239_a_17	Eblan can wait! We've gotta stop this guy before it's too late!
E0057_01_239_a_18	But...
E0057_01_239_a_19	Ahh, stop worrying and go home. I'll be fine.
E0057_01_239_a_20	Very well... Everyone, please take good care of our prince.
E0057_01_239_a_21	May fortune favor you, Your Highness!
E0057_01_239_a_22	Thank you, everyone!
E0057_01_239_a_23	Okay, let's go get Golbez!
E0057_01_239_a_24	We need to get the Crystals first.
E0057_01_239_a_25	Right, right. Lead the way!
E0058_00_321_a_01	It's a trap!!!
E0058_00_321_a_02	Owww... That hurt!
E0058_00_321_a_03	That was a nasty drop.
E0059_00_347_a_01	!?
E0059_00_347_a_02	An enemy airship!
E0059_00_347_a_03	Let's use it to get outta here.
E0059_00_347_a_04	But that's stealing!
E0059_00_347_a_05	Who cares? Besides, we'll put it to better use!
E0059_00_347_a_06	It could be another trap.
E0059_00_347_a_07	Hey, she's not bad. Let's call her...Falcon! What do you think, (RYDIA)?
E0059_00_347_a_08	What does it matter? Let's get going!
E0059_00_347_a_09	Yes, let's go.
E0059_00_347_a_10	Falcon, take us up!
E0055_00_232_a_01	Rubicante! At last we meet!
E0055_00_232_a_02	Am I supposed to know who you are?
E0055_00_232_a_03	I am (EDGE), Prince of Eblan!
E0055_00_232_a_04	Eblan? I don't believe I've heard that name before.
E0055_00_232_a_05	It doesn't matter, because you're about to meet your demise!
E0055_01_232_a_01	Agh!
E0055_01_232_a_02	I must say, I'm quite impressed. Continue your training. I look forward to our next meeting.
E0055_01_232_a_03	Come...back!
E0055_01_232_a_04	Are you alright!?
E0055_01_232_a_05	I can't believe I lost...<P>\nWho are you?
E0055_01_232_a_06	We're after Rubicante, same as you.
E0055_01_232_a_07	Stay out of this! He's mine!
E0055_01_232_a_08	Well, you obviously don't know who you're dealing with.<P>\nHe's one of the four Elemental Lords.
E0055_01_232_a_09	You saw how easily he overpowered you just now!
E0055_01_232_a_10	Hah! You take me for some craven prince?<P>\nI'm the rightful heir to the throne of Eblan, a kingdom long famed for its ninjutsu.<P>\nLeave! I can take care of myself!
E0055_01_232_a_11	Stop it!
E0055_01_232_a_12	(TELLA), (YANG), (CID)... They're all gone...<P>\nPlease, no more... *sob*
E0055_01_232_a_13	Hey...
E0055_01_232_a_14	(RYDIA)...
E0055_01_232_a_15	*sob sob*
E0055_01_232_a_16	Rubicante is the strongest of the four lords.<P>\nThe odds might be against us, but somehow we must recover the Crystals.
E0055_01_232_a_17	Alright, I'll let you take a share of the action. I never could bear to see a pretty girl cry.
E0055_01_232_a_18	He's got quite a mouth... (ROZA), give him a hand.
E0055_01_232_a_19	Cura!
E0055_01_232_a_20	Thanks! Not one but two charming ladies! Maybe this won't be so bad after all.
E0055_01_232_a_21	Alright, let's do this!
E0055_01_232_a_22	Gee, I don't know about him...
E0055_01_232_a_23	Ninja (EDGE) has joined the party.
N102_C01_227_01_01	Who goes there? Oh, humans...
N102_C01_227_01_02	Show the world the power of ninjutsu, Your Highness!
N102_C01_227_03_01	With our castle destroyed, this is all that is left of our kingdom.
N102_C01_227_02_01	We are the proud people of Eblan!
N102_C01_227_07_01	We only have a little food left. I wonder how long it will last us...
N102_C01_227_06_01	Those who survived the attack are hiding inside.
N102_C01_227_05_01	The prince went to scout ahead, but has yet to return.
N102_C01_227_05_02	We will hold the fort until the prince returns.
N102_C01_227_04_01	This passageway leads to the Tower of Babel, where Rubicante's center of operations is located.
N102_C01_230_01_01	How did they defeat our ninjutsu so easily?
N102_C01_230_02_01	Where did that monster come from?
N102_C01_230_03_01	I can't believe the horrific fate that befell the king and queen...
N104_C02_230_04_01	I am a senior minister of Eblan. The prince does not mince his words, but he's a good man.<P>\nHe went to the Tower of Babel to avenge his parents.
N104_C02_230_04_02	Do not worry about us, Your Highness. Please be careful.
N106_C01_230_05_01	I'm gonna protect my mom so no one can hurt her! I'm gonna have a little brother or sister soon!
N103_C01_230_07_01	He's such a brave boy...
N103_C01_230_06_01	Perhaps Eblan's ninjutsu will die out with us...
N103_C02_230_09_01	Hang in there, my darling!
N102_C01_230_10_01	The prince will surely defeat our enemy.
N102_C01_230_10_02	The prince... Is he well? No, no—I'm sure he's fine as a fiddle!
N107_C02_230_08_01	The prince said that once he's taken care of the monsters, we can finally go back to the castle!
N101_C01_231_01_01	The prince went on alone!
N101_C01_231_02_01	When the prince gets worked up like that, no one can stop him!
N101_C01_232_01_01	Please, stop the prince.
N101_C01_232_02_01	The prince went after Rubicante...
N101_C01_232_03_01	Your Highness, please take caution!
E0110_00_263_a_01	...
E0112_00_263_a_01	Hey! Stop—
E0112_00_263_a_02	...<P>\nI-is it time for training? Allow me to sleep a little more...
E0112_00_263_a_03	(CECIL)!?
E0112_00_263_a_04	(YANG)!
E0112_00_263_a_05	I'm so glad you're awake!
E0112_00_263_a_06	The sylphs saved my life.
E0112_00_263_a_07	Well you saved us by destroying the cannons.
E0112_00_263_a_08	I shall join you once again.
E0112_00_263_a_09	You must rest!
E0112_00_263_a_10	I cannot rest while my friends risk their lives.
E0112_00_263_a_11	Just take it easy.
E0112_00_263_a_12	You are?
E0112_00_263_a_13	I'm (EDGE) of Eblan. Don't worry. I can fill in for you.
E0112_00_263_a_14	Eblan. So you are a ninja. But I must—
E0112_00_263_a_15	No! We'll fight in your place instead.
E0112_00_263_a_16	?
E0112_00_263_a_17	She's a summoner, correct? Then she may call upon us at any time.
E0112_00_263_a_18	Thank you!
E0112_00_263_a_19	(RYDIA) has learned Sylph.
E0112_00_263_a_20	I am most grateful.
N035_C00_263_04_01	We found him lying near the mouth of the cave. He told us his name, but then he passed out.<P>\nWe've been taking care of him ever since, but he's yet to reawaken...
N035_C00_263_04_02	What if (YANG) dies!?
N035_C00_263_04_03	Please give (YANG) our regards.
N035_C00_263_04_04	You're a summoner, correct? Then you may call upon us at any time.<P>\nWe're happy to fight in (YANG)'s stead. He showed us how kind and strong humans can be.
N035_C00_263_03_01	We won't hand (YANG) over!
N035_C00_263_03_02	Humans are so violent.
N035_C00_263_03_03	If he has a wife, I can't stop him from leaving.
N035_C00_263_02_01	Go away!
N035_C00_263_02_02	Please don't take (YANG) away.
N035_C00_263_02_03	We'll all miss him...
N035_C00_263_01_01	Yikes! Humans!
N035_C00_263_01_02	We'll take care of (YANG).
N035_C00_263_01_03	I'm glad (YANG)'s all better now!
P008_C00_263_05_01	...
E0119_00_265_a_01	I passed through here when I left the Land of Summons.<P>\nPerhaps we should go ask Leviathan for help.
E0120_01_00_143_a_01	Queen Asura!
E0120_01_00_143_a_02	(RYDIA), dear, what brings you back to us?
E0120_01_00_143_a_03	We need your help.
E0120_01_00_143_a_04	Do you possess the strength and courage to challenge me?
E0120_01_00_143_a_05	Then I am sorry, but I cannot be of any help to you.
E0120_01_00_143_a_06	Let us begin the test!
E0120_02_01_143_a_01	You have proven your worth, (RYDIA). You may summon me whenever you desire.
E0120_02_01_143_a_02	(RYDIA) has learned Asura.
E0120_03_00_143_a_01	A strong spirit is required to steer one's powers toward righteousness.<P>\nWill you test your spirit against mine?
E0120_03_00_143_a_02	Return when you are ready.
E0120_03_01_143_a_01	Indeed, your spirit is righteous. I, Leviathan, King of Summons, shall serve you.
E0120_03_01_143_a_02	(RYDIA) has learned Leviathan.
N013_C01_134_01_01	(RYDIA), you have returned!
N013_C00_134_04_01	(RYDIA) was the first human to ever come here.
N013_C02_134_03_01	This is the Land of Summons, the home of all summon monsters.
N013_C00_134_02_01	The King of Summons resides below.
N013_C02_136_01_01	It's been a long time, (RYDIA)!
N116_C03_136_02_01	Hey there, (RYDIA)! What? You've never met a talking chocobo before?
N116_C03_136_03_01	(RYDIA)! Good to see you've come back!
N116_C03_136_04_01	Hello, (RYDIA)! Are those your friends?
N013_C02_136_06_01	They say you can't meet the king without defeating Queen Asura first!
N013_C01_136_08_01	This land is ruled by Queen Asura and the King of Summons.
N013_C01_136_07_01	People say my brethren get up to no good when they visit different worlds!
N116_C03_136_05_01	This is the library. It holds knowledge beyond your imagination.
N013_C01_139_02_01	I wonder if humans have the skill to wield our weapons.
N013_C02_139_03_01	Hey, it's (RYDIA)!
N013_C01_140_02_01	You shouldn't be bringing humans here, (RYDIA).
N013_C00_140_03_01	We just want to live in peace and quiet.
N013_C02_137_06_01	How's Ifrit? Still hot-headed?
N013_C01_137_05_01	Chocobo, Shiva, Ramuh... They all live here.
N013_C02_137_04_01	Titan's got nothing if you cast Float.
N013_C01_138_01_01	(RYDIA), please stay here with us!
N013_C01_141_01_01	This book is so moving...
N013_C00_141_02_01	Shhh! This is a library, for crying out loud!
N999_C02_141_04_01	Titan, Shaker of the Earth<P>\nTitan's power rips through the earth, tearing open an abyss so wide as to swallow any and all.
N999_C02_141_05_01	Ifrit, Spawn of Flame<P>\nIfrit's flame has the power to incinerate all in its path.
N999_C02_141_06_01	It is said that there are other forms of summon magic that still lie undiscovered...
N999_C02_141_07_01	Ramuh, the Good Elder<P>\nRamuh's wrath calls forth dark clouds that condemn enemies with bolts of lightning.
N999_C02_141_08_01	Shiva, Queen of Ice<P>\nThose who anger Shiva will be instantly transformed into a statue of ice.
N999_C02_141_09_01	Chocobo<P>\nThe cutest of all summons, and the first to flee from battle.
N999_C02_141_01_01	Summon Magic<P>\nA type of magic used to call forth monsters in times of need. Only a few still hold this power.
N999_C02_141_02_01	The history of the world of humans is brief compared to that of the Land of Summons.
N999_C02_141_03_01	Only those with great physical and mental strength may enter the cave that leads to the world of humans...
N013_C00_142_01_01	There are many, many books here. It would take several lifetimes to read everything.
N013_C01_142_02_01	Do you have literature in your world, too?
N999_C02_142_06_01	If Scan fails to indicate the nature of a monster, you may wish to consult the Bestiary.
N999_C02_142_07_01	Summons, Monsters, Humans<P>\nWhat happened in the past? What does the future hold? Life is an eternal mystery.
N999_C02_142_08_01	Long, long ago, a giant whale descended to Earth from the moon. Presently, it is in a deep sleep within the dragon.
N999_C02_142_09_01	The God of Summons created us and watches over us from afar, never having known defeat.<P>\nPerhaps the only way to defeat him is to reflect his own strength against him.
N999_C02_142_10_01	Two Moons<P>\nIn the ancient sky, the two moons were one. So it is written.
N999_C02_142_01_01	Asura, Queen of Summons<P>\nShe guards the path that leads to her husband, the King of Summons.<P>\nOnly those who surpass her power may behold the king's true form.
N999_C02_142_02_01	The King of Summons<P>\nThe ruler of the vast ocean, he appeared one day from the northern sea. His powers are without equal in this land.
N999_C02_142_03_01	Odin, Master of the Blade<P>\nHis only defeat occurred when his sword was struck by a bolt of lightning. <P>\nZantetsuken, his ultimate attack, annihilates any enemy with a single blow.
N999_C02_142_04_01	Sylphs, Kindly Creatures<P>\nWhen they combine their power, they can unleash their true strength.
N999_C02_142_05_01	Laws of the Land of Summons<P>\nTrue strength lies only in the souls of the righteous, and one must prove their worth to attain it.
N013_C02_143_01_01	This is the royal chamber.
N013_C02_143_02_01	You must receive permission from Queen Asura before you may approach the king.
N104_C00_143_03_01	You think I'm the king? No, no, I'm just an old man.
N112_C00_144_03_01	Mercy me! Where'd you come from?
N112_C00_144_02_01	Did you know that there's an island to the northwest that leads to the Land of Summons? Scary, eh?
N112_C00_144_01_01	I hear the seas of the overworld are blue. How disturbing!
N112_C00_144_04_01	Lali-ho? No, here we say "howdy-ho"!
N112_C00_144_05_01	You come from the overworld? Mercy me! So there really is an overworld.
N112_C00_144_06_01	Howdy-ho! So the castle's had it rough recently. What happened?
N112_C00_146_01_01	Sylphs are afraid of us, even though we're actually quite nice.
N112_C00_146_02_01	They say sylphs live in a cave far to the northwest.
N112_C00_147_03_01	Oooh, a guest! We haven't had one for ages!
N112_C00_148_01_01	You sure came a long way. Here, take all you want!
N112_C00_148_02_01	Howdy-ho! Take our stuff! It's free!
E0062_00_268_a_01	The way to the jewel of darkness opens only for those able to show proof of their right of passage.
E0063_ 00_290_a_01	Obtained Dark Crystal.
E0064_ 00_289_a_01	The walls!
E0064_ 00_289_a_02	They're moving!
E0064_ 00_289_a_03	Removing the Crystal must have set off a trap!
E0064_ 00_289_a_04	So much for a smooth exit.
E0064_ 01_289_a_01	Alright!
E0064_ 01_289_a_02	Nothing to it!
E0065_ 00_268_a_01	What's going on?
E0065_ 00_268_a_02	(CAIN)... You belong to me, (CAIN). Bring me the Crystal.
E0065_ 00_268_a_03	Golbez!
E0065_ 00_268_a_04	(CAIN)!
E0065_ 00_268_a_05	Get ahold of yourself!
E0065_ 00_268_a_06	I'm...alright. I'm no longer under his control!
E0065_ 00_268_a_07	Ugh...
E0065_ 00_268_a_08	The Dark Crystal was seized!
E0065_ 00_268_a_09	What're you doing!?
E0065_ 00_268_a_10	(CAIN)!
E0065_ 00_268_a_11	Now I can restore the Tower of Babel. At last, I shall reach the moon!
E0065_ 00_268_a_12	(CAIN)! Wake up!
E0065_ 00_268_a_13	...
E0065_ 00_268_a_14	Please! (CAIN)!
E0065_ 00_268_a_15	With all the Crystals in our possession, the way to the moon will open!
E0065_ 00_268_a_16	Stop!
E0065_ 00_268_a_17	Mwahahaha!
E0065_ 00_268_a_18	...
E0065_ 00_268_a_19	Damn!
P013_C00_ 274_02_01	Trapdoor?
E0105_00_117_a_01	Beat it! I'll talk to you only when you bring me a tail.
E0105_00_117_a_02	Th-this is the rat tail I've been looking for! Alright, here's some ore in return.
E0105_00_117_a_03	Received Adamantite.
N122_C01_117_02_01	Th-this is the legendary pink tail! Here, take this in return!
N122_C01_117_02_02	Received Adamant Armor.
N122_C02_117_01_01	Dad found an unusual ore here, but he'd rather find a rare animal tail. He collects them.
E0106_00_151_a_01	My smithing days are over! I won't forge another sword until I find the legendary ore, adamantite.
E0106_00_151_a_02	Adamantite! Give me that old sword! I'll give it new life!
E0106_00_151_a_03	Handed over Sword of Legend.
E0107_00_150_a_01	It's ready! The holy sword Excalibur! Use it well!
E0107_00_150_a_02	Received Excalibur.
N112_C00_150_02_01	This is Master Kokkol's workshop, home of the world's finest blacksmith.
N112_C00_150_02_02	The master's back to his old self!
N112_C00_150_01_01	The master lost his spark. Now he just sleeps the days away.
N112_C00_150_01_02	I'm gonna work hard to become an even better smith than the master!
N112_C00_150_01_03	Look what the master made!
N112_C00_150_03_01	Hey, give me some time! Don't rush me!
N112_C00_150_03_02	I've rekindled the love of smithing that I'd lost!
N012_C02_152_04_01	Long ago, one of our people built a ship and traveled to the blue planet. He was adept at naming things.
N012_C00_152_03_01	We are the Hummingways.
N012_C02_152_02_01	You wish to change your name? Whatever do you mean?
N012_C01_152_5	Hummm... Hum...
E0069_00_153_a_01	Welcome!
E0069_00_153_a_02	You are?
E0069_00_153_a_03	I am (FOOSUYA). My duty is to protect the slumber of the lunarians.
E0069_00_153_a_04	The lunarians?
E0069_00_153_a_05	Many years ago, a small planet between Mars and Jupiter was on the verge of destruction.<P>\nThe inhabitants escaped on a ship to the blue planet.
E0069_00_153_a_06	The what?
E0069_00_153_a_07	I'm referring to your Earth.<P>\nHowever, they were in the midst of evolving, so they created a moon where they could sleep a long slumber.
E0069_00_153_a_08	So that's where lunarians come from...
E0069_00_153_a_09	However, there was one who refused to sleep.<P>\nInstead, he wished to raze everything on the blue planet and create a new home there.
E0069_00_153_a_10	How awful...
E0069_00_153_a_11	I was able to seal him away with my powers and force him into a deep sleep.<P>\nBut in spite of this, he was able to channel his evil into the corrupt inhabitants of your planet.<P>\nNow he uses them to gather the Crystals.
E0069_00_153_a_12	Then he must be the one behind Golbez's actions!
E0069_00_153_a_13	Who is this lowlife?
E0069_00_153_a_14	His name is Zemus.<P>\nHe is gathering the Crystals, our energy source, to activate the dimensional elevator in the Giant of Babel.<P>\nThen he intends to destroy everything on your planet.
E0069_00_153_a_15	No!
E0069_00_153_a_16	However, many of us feel we can come to an understanding with the people of Earth.<P>\nThose lunarians are merely sleeping, waiting for your people to reach the right level of evolution.
E0069_00_153_a_17	What about the Lunar Whale?
E0069_00_153_a_18	That was built years ago by my younger brother KluYa, as transportation to the blue planet.<P>\nHe had always dreamed of visiting unknown lands. The Devil's Road and airship technology were also born from his desire to explore.<P>\nOn the blue planet, KluYa fell in love and had two children.<P>\nYou...are one of his children.
E0069_00_153_a_19	Me!? Then the voice I heard on Mt. Ordeals was...
E0069_00_153_a_20	The voice came from the soul of KluYa, your father.<P>\nI see it now... You resemble him when he was your age.
E0069_00_153_a_21	That was the voice...of my father!
E0069_00_153_a_22	You have received power from KluYa to stop Zemus and his evil plan.<P>\nYou must do this for your own planet and for all lunarians!<P>\nYou must hurry to the Tower of Babel in Eblan!
E0069_00_153_a_23	The Tower of Babel? How will we get around its barrier?
E0069_00_153_a_24	I should be able to enter. We cannot let the Giant of Babel reach the blue planet!<P>\nI will join you on your journey.
E0069_00_153_a_25	Lunarian (FOOSUYA) has joined the party.
E0073_00_154_a_01	We shall guide you to the core.
B006_C00_154_01_01	We are the Crystals of the moon.
B006_C00_154_01_02	The fall of the Tower of Babel broke the seal placed on Zemus. Now you may reach him.
B006_C00_154_02_01	The eight Crystals on your planet maintain the equilibrium that keeps the moon in orbit.
B006_C00_154_02_02	Powerful weapons that once posed a threat to lunarians are sealed away in the core along with Zemus.
B006_C00_154_03_01	We surround the entrance to the central core, where Zemus lies.
B006_C00_154_03_02	We shall guide you to the core.
B006_C00_154_04_01	Zemus has raised his own barrier from within to seal the path to the core.
B006_C00_154_04_02	You must head for the moon's core.
B006_C00_154_05_01	Zemus used Golbez to gather the Earth's Crystals and amplified their energy at the Tower of Babel.
B006_C00_154_05_02	We are the Crystals of the moon.
B006_C00_154_06_01	We, the eight Crystals of the moon, keep Zemus sealed away.
B006_C00_154_06_02	A tremendous energy field exists between Zemus and our people.
B006_C00_154_07_01	Even in captivity, Zemus continues to intensify the power of his will.
B006_C00_154_07_02	Containing Zemus's madness strains our power to the utmost.
B006_C00_154_08_01	The lunarians sleep deep within the core. (FOOSUYA) has protected them for eons.
B006_C00_154_08_02	(FOOSUYA) entered the core with KluYa's son some time ago...
N999_C08_154_01_01	It is sealed by an invisible force.
E0125_00_295_a_01	You may have won Leviathan over, but that proves nothing.<P>\nI, Bahamut, God of Summons, shall deliver the final judgment!
E0125_00_295_b_01	5
E0125_00_295_b_02	4
E0125_00_295_b_03	3
E0125_00_295_b_04	2
E0125_00_295_b_05	1
E0125_01_295_a_01	Your spirit and strength are worthy indeed. (RYDIA), summon me as you wish.
E0125_01_295_a_02	(RYDIA) has learned Bahamut.
N106_C00_295_01_01	What do you want!?
N106_C00_295_01_02	You are the first ones to be accepted by the God of Summons.
N107_C00_295_02_01	Oh... You're an interesting one.
N107_C00_295_02_02	It appears a tremendous fate awaits you.
N016_C00_295_03_01	The King of Summons has not acknowledged you. Please leave.
N016_C00_295_03_02	Your spirit and strength are worthy indeed. (RYDIA), summon me as you wish.
E0070_04_160_a_01	Ahhh!
E0070_04_160_a_02	The tower!
E0070_04_160_a_03	We are too late!
E0070_04_160_a_04	What do you mean, "too late"!?
E0070_04_160_a_05	The Giant of Babel will come forth!
E0070_06_160_a_01	No!
E0070_06_160_a_02	Dammit!
E0070_06_160_a_03	Is there nothing we can do?
E0070_06_160_a_04	What's that!?
E0070_08_345_a_01	Dwarven tanks, ready to fire! We will fight alongside you for the planet, our home!
E0070_08_345_a_02	Lali-ho!
E0070_09_345_a_01	I could not lie in bed and leave the responsibility of fighting to my friends!
E0070_11_346_a_01	You can relax now! With my help, this'll be a cinch!<P>\nAll engines to full power!
E0070_11_346_a_02	Yes, sir!
E0070_12_346_a_01	Hey, all! Miss me!?
E0070_12_346_a_02	The elder restored us.
E0070_12_346_a_03	You should not fight this battle alone! We all must fight for the sake of our survival!
E0070_13_346_a_01	I will fight with you, (CECIL), with the courage you have given me!
E0070_15_160_a_01	Thank you!
E0070_15_160_a_02	The giant looks confused!
E0070_15_160_a_03	Now is our chance to enter the Giant of Babel!
E0070_15_160_a_04	I get it! We're going for the core! Its heart!
E0070_15_160_a_05	(CID)!
E0070_17_346_a_01	Approach its mouth.
E0070_17_346_a_02	Who's he?
E0070_17_346_a_03	(FOOSUYA), a lunarian.
E0070_17_346_a_04	He's a lunarian?
E0070_17_346_a_05	Can you do this or not?
E0070_17_346_a_06	Ahh, keep your beard on. There's nothing I can't do!
E0070_17_346_a_07	Now!
E0070_17_346_a_08	Hang on!
E0071_00_243_a_01	You have come at last.
E0071_00_243_a_02	You cannot stop the Giant of Babel.
E0071_00_243_a_03	Hahaha... Now is the time...
E0071_00_243_a_04	...for the death of you all!
E0071_00_243_a_05	The Elemental Lords!
E0071_00_243_a_06	Indeed.
E0071_00_243_a_07	Master Zemus blessed us with a second life.
E0071_00_243_a_08	Prepare to die.
E0071_00_243_a_09	I shall enjoy fighting you again.<P>\nYou have taught us of the power that comes from joining forces. That is what we will do.<P>\nNow, allow me to restore your strength.
E0071_00_243_a_10	HP and MP restored.
E0071_00_243_a_11	This time, we shall prevail.
E0071_01_243_a_01	Master Zemus!
E0071_01_243_a_02	Please, one last chance...
E0071_01_243_a_03	We have failed again...
E0071_01_243_a_04	Farewell, valiants.
E0072_00_249_a_01	This is the core of the giant, its CPU!
E0072_00_249_a_02	Whoa...
E0072_00_249_a_03	We have to destroy the Defense Node first, because it can repair the CPU!
E0072_01_249_a_01	Alright!
E0072_01_249_a_02	We stopped it!
E0072_01_249_a_03	Why, you!
E0072_01_249_a_04	How dare you destroy the giant!
E0072_01_249_a_05	You!
E0072_01_249_a_06	Do I know you?
E0072_01_249_a_07	You have to look deep inside yourself! You have to realize who you really are!
E0072_01_249_a_08	Stop it!
E0072_01_249_a_09	You must wake up!
E0072_01_249_a_10	What came over me? Why was I filled...with so much hatred?
E0072_01_249_a_11	You have returned to your true self.<P>\nNow, do you remember your father's name?
E0072_01_249_a_12	My father...is KluYa.
E0072_01_249_a_13	What!?
E0072_01_249_a_14	Then that makes you (CECIL)'s...
E0072_01_249_a_15	You two are brothers!?
E0072_01_249_a_16	I have a brother...
E0072_01_249_a_17	You were a puppet in Zemus's plan. He was manipulating you with his hypnotic powers.<P>\nHe chose you because you have the blood of KluYa, a lunarian, coursing through your body.<P>\nThat made it easier for Zemus to control you.<P>\nBut to make you fight against your own flesh and blood...
E0072_01_249_a_18	That's enough!
E0072_01_249_a_19	I was fighting...against my own brother? All of this hate...was against my own family?
E0072_01_249_a_20	You're my...?
E0072_01_249_a_21	I wonder why you were chosen.<P>\nIt easily could have been me—we both have lunarian blood.
E0072_01_249_a_22	I was chosen...because of the seeds of evil that lay inside me.<P>\nZemus saw that evil...and he helped it grow...
E0072_01_249_a_23	Where are you going!?
E0072_01_249_a_24	To find Zemus! I have a score to settle!
E0072_01_249_a_25	Wait!
E0072_01_249_a_26	I, too, am a lunarian, just like Zemus. I will join you!
E0072_01_249_a_27	Goodbye, (CECIL).
E0072_01_249_a_28	Is this what you want, (CECIL)?
E0072_01_249_a_29	Golbez is never coming back... You know that, right?
E0072_01_249_a_30	...
E0072_01_249_a_31	Aren't you going to do anything? He's your brother!
E0072_01_249_a_32	My...brother...
E0072_01_249_a_33	Yes!
E0072_01_249_a_34	...
E0072_01_249_a_35	We might be in trouble...
E0072_01_249_a_36	We have to get out of here!
E0072_01_249_a_37	(CECIL)!
E0072_01_249_a_38	...
E0072_01_249_a_39	What are you doing!?
E0072_01_249_a_40	We need to find a way out!
E0072_01_249_a_41	This way!
E0072_01_249_a_42	(CAIN)!
E0072_01_249_a_43	Oh no, we're not falling for that again!
E0072_01_249_a_44	We can talk later! Right now, we have to get out of here!
E0072_01_249_a_45	Hurry!
E0072_03_161_a_1	Finally, I was able to return to my senses...<P>\nI don't expect you to forgive me, after all I've done...
E0072_03_161_a_2	Of course we're not gonna forgive you! The giant was practically your doing!
E0072_03_161_a_3	Stop it!
E0072_03_161_a_4	(ROZA)...
E0072_03_161_a_5	It's not (CAIN)'s fault! You saw how Zemus had control over Golbez!
E0072_03_161_a_6	Golbez too?
E0072_03_161_a_7	Golbez is...(CECIL)'s older brother...
E0072_03_161_a_8	...
E0072_03_161_a_9	He was being manipulated by a lunarian named Zemus, who used their shared lunarian blood to control him.
E0072_03_161_a_10	Golbez and (FOOSUYA) went to the moon to destroy Zemus.
E0072_03_161_a_11	Golbez is (CECIL)'s...brother?
E0072_03_161_a_12	Then I, too, should follow them and give Zemus the payback he deserves!
E0072_03_161_a_13	I hope you don't end up betraying us again.
E0072_03_161_a_14	If that happens, you can kill me.
E0072_03_161_a_15	Then I'd better go too! Besides, I want to give this Zemus guy a piece of my mind!
E0072_03_161_a_16	(EDGE)...
E0072_03_161_a_17	Then it's decided...
E0072_03_161_a_18	We go to the moon!
E0072_03_161_a_19	(CECIL)...
E0072_03_161_a_20	(ROZA), (RYDIA). You two stay here. The three of us will go.<P>\nI can't put you in any more danger.
E0072_03_161_a_21	But (CECIL)!
E0072_03_161_a_22	That's not fair!
E0072_03_161_a_23	Please, you have to get off the Lunar Whale.
E0072_03_161_a_24	A little kid won't be much help, anyway.
E0072_03_161_a_25	Who're you calling a kid!?
E0072_03_161_a_26	Just stay put, kid...
E0072_03_161_a_27	(CECIL)...
E0072_03_161_a_28	(CAIN)! (EDGE)!
E0072_07_161_a_01	Let's go!
E0072_07_161_a_02	(ROZA)!
E0072_07_161_a_03	...
E0072_07_161_a_04	Get out of the way, (ROZA).
E0072_07_161_a_05	No! I'm not moving! You have to take me with you!
E0072_07_161_a_06	Why are you doing this?
E0072_07_161_a_07	Because I don't want us to be apart. I don't care what happens, as long as I'm with you.
E0072_07_161_a_08	(ROZA)...
E0072_07_161_a_09	I guess we have no choice.
E0072_07_161_a_10	Well, aren't you the ladies' man!
E0072_07_161_a_11	Alright... (ROZA), I'll protect you with my life.
E0072_07_161_a_12	It worked!
E0072_07_161_a_13	What!? You!
E0072_07_161_a_14	This is everyone's war, not just yours!<P>\nBesides, I'm the only one who can summon creatures to help us!
E0072_07_161_a_15	(RYDIA)... You're right, this war is ours to fight together!<P>\nLet's go!
E0116_00_298_a_01	To the seeker of this blade, I bring death!
E0116_01_298_a_01	You found Rainbow Robe!
E0117_00_302_a_01	Those damned by Zemus shall never bear this sword!
E0117_01_302_a_01	You found Asura Rod!
E0114_00_311_a_01	The coveter of the Holy Lance shall perish!
E0114_01_311_a_01	You found Hero Shield!
E0118_00_312_a_01	By sacred force, we shall protect the ribbons.
E0115_00_313_a_01	None shall ever bear the cursed sword, Masamune!
E0115_00_313_a_02	You found Asura Rod!
E0074_00_317_a_01	Golbez! (FOOSUYA)!
E0074_00_317_b_01	Now! Cast Meteor!
E0074_00_317_b_02	I am ready!
E0074_00_317_b_03	How futile...
E0074_00_317_b_04	The body dies...
E0074_00_317_b_05	...but the spirit lives on.
E0074_01_317_a_01	We did it...
E0074_01_317_a_02	You have much strength. It is a shame Zemus had control over you.
E0074_01_317_a_03	Alright!
E0074_01_317_a_04	All of you have come!
E0074_01_317_a_05	Yeah, but we were one second too late—I was supposed to take care of him!
E0074_01_317_a_06	(CECIL)...
E0074_01_317_a_07	...
E0074_01_317_a_08	(CECIL)...
E0074_01_317_a_09	I am...evil... I am...the...hatred of Zemus...
E0074_01_317_a_10	I am...Zeromus... I loathe...all!
E0074_01_317_a_11	His death caused his hatred to grow! We have made him stronger!
E0074_01_317_a_12	Zemus... No, now you are Zeromus!<P>\nThis time I will see to it that you are completely destroyed!
E0074_01_317_a_13	It is time for you...to disappear!
E0074_01_317_b_01	Meteor has no effect!
E0074_01_317_b_02	Use the Crystal!
E0074_01_317_b_03	You chose the dark path.
E0074_01_317_b_04	The Crystal cannot cleanse your sins.
E0074_01_317_b_05	You are bound forever by darkness!
E0074_01_317_b_06	Die!
E0074_01_317_b_07	Suffer... Die...<P>\nMy hatred...will continue...until all...is destroyed...<P>\nIt is your turn... Come... Join me...in hell!
E0074_03_60_a_1	Elder!
E0074_03_60_a_2	(CECIL) and the others are in danger!
E0074_03_60_a_3	So I see...
E0074_03_60_a_4	Now is the time to pray for them! Pray for them and this planet!
E0074_03_60_a_5	(PALOM), (POLOM)! We must gather everyone's prayers and send them to (CECIL)!
E0074_03_60_a_6	(CECIL)...
E0074_03_60_a_7	Please, take my strength!
E0074_03_60_a_8	I'm gonna kill the whole lot of you if you don't come back safe!
E0074_03_60_a_9	Please return to us safely!
E0074_03_60_a_10	Do it for this land!
E0074_03_60_a_11	You have our support!
E0074_03_60_a_12	We pray for you as well!
E0074_03_60_a_13	Come on!
E0074_03_60_a_14	For Sir (CECIL)! For everyone!
E0074_03_60_a_15	Moon, I call out to you! Please accept our prayers!
E0074_04_317_a_01	G-Golbez!
E0074_04_317_a_02	You must...use this!
E0074_04_317_a_03	Received Crystal.
E0074_04_317_a_04	Zeromus! I won't lose! I...can't!
E0074_04_317_b_01	Hey there!
E0074_04_317_b_02	Let us help you!
E0074_04_317_b_03	Their prayers give you life.
E0074_04_317_b_04	Don't give up!
E0074_04_317_b_05	Trust in your power.
E0074_04_317_b_06	Their prayers give you strength.
E0074_04_317_b_07	Keep your focus!
E0074_04_317_b_08	Don't die on us!
E0074_04_317_b_09	Their prayers give you vitality.
E0074_04_317_b_10	You must prevail.
E0074_04_317_b_11	(CECIL), my brother.
E0074_04_317_b_12	Give the holy power within you
E0074_04_317_b_13	to the Crystal.
E0074_04_317_b_14	Zeromus! Show your true self!
E0074_04_317_b_15	Their prayers give you holy power.
E0074_04_317_b_16	Zeromus reveals his true form!
E0074_04_317_b_17	Gr...gh...ga...
E0074_04_317_b_18	All magic has been nullified!
E0074_05_317_a_01	As long...as evil...exists in the hearts...of the living...I cannot...perish... Graaah!
E0074_05_317_a_02	Well done!
E0074_05_317_a_03	I had no idea you all possessed such strength.<P>\nPerhaps the people of the blue planet have evolved beyond us lunarians already.
E0074_05_317_a_04	Yeah, you might be right!
E0074_05_317_a_05	Zeromus's last words bother me, though...
E0074_05_317_a_06	As long as evil exists...
E0074_05_317_a_07	True evil will never die.<P>\nEvery living creature has at least a touch of evil in its heart, alongside goodness.<P>\nAs long as there is light and darkness, the overworld and the underworld, it will be so.<P>\nGood exists because evil exists, and it was your good that destroyed Zemus's evil.
E0074_05_317_a_08	Oh, stop it, already! There was nothing to it!
E0074_05_317_a_09	What are you talking about!? I was surprised Zemus didn't try to control you!<P>\nI'm sure you have enough evil inside!
E0074_05_317_a_10	Nope! My heart is filled with goodness all the way!
E0074_05_317_a_11	Well, it is time I returned home. What will the rest of you do now?
E0074_05_317_a_12	I think we'll go home too.
E0074_05_317_a_13	Yes, there are people worried about us!
E0074_05_317_a_14	I see. I am glad you have such wonderful friends.<P>\nI look forward to the day we meet again!
E0074_05_317_a_15	May I... May I come with you?
E0074_05_317_a_16	You wish to join me?
E0074_05_317_a_17	Yes... I cannot return home, not after all I've done.<P>\nI would very much like to meet my father's people.
E0074_05_317_a_18	Ah, yes. Lunarian blood flows in your veins... Very well, come along.<P>\nBut you must be ready for a long, long sleep.
E0074_05_317_a_19	I am. Thank you.
E0074_05_317_a_20	You sounded very worried when you called my name, (CECIL)... Does that mean you've forgiven me?
E0074_05_317_a_21	...
E0074_05_317_a_22	...How foolish of me, of course not. I have caused too much suffering for that.
E0074_05_317_a_23	We are off to spend many years in slumber. We pray that the blue planet will be peaceful forevermore.
E0074_05_317_a_24	Come.
E0074_05_317_a_25	Yes.
E0074_05_317_a_26	(CECIL)...
E0074_05_317_a_27	Are you certain you want to part this way?
E0074_05_317_a_28	He's your brother!
E0074_05_317_a_29	Goodbye, everyone.
E0074_05_317_a_30	(CECIL)!
E0074_05_317_a_31	...<P>\n...Goodbye! Goodbye, my brother!
E0074_05_317_a_32	(CECIL)...

E0074_08_335_a_01	We shall begin today's training.
E0074_08_335_a_02	Yes, sir.
E0074_08_335_a_03	Hm? Where's (PALOM)?
E0074_08_335_a_04	Oh no, not again!
E0074_09_336_a_01	...And then, I cast Blizzard on the creatures that we encountered at Mt. Ordeals—
E0074_09_336_a_02	*whack*
E0074_09_336_a_03	Owww!
E0074_09_336_a_04	How many times are you going to be late to training!? The elder is really angry!
E0074_10_335_a_01	How many times do I have to scold you before you learn!?
E0074_10_335_a_02	It will be years before you are even half the sage (TELLA) was!
E0074_10_335_a_03	As punishment, you must train twice as hard as your sister today!
E0074_10_335_a_04	That's not fair!
E0074_10_335_a_05	I think it's very fair!
E0074_11_337_a_01	When will you come to realize that you have responsibilities!? You are heir to the throne!
E0074_11_337_a_02	I know, I know! Geez!
E0074_11_337_a_03	Your mouth says you know, but your actions say otherwise!
E0074_11_337_a_04	Yeah, yeah.
E0074_11_337_a_05	The correct words here would be "Yes, sir!"
E0074_11_337_a_06	Alright, I'll shape up. *sigh*<P>\nI can't help but think about (RYDIA), though... *sigh*
E0074_11_337_a_07	Your Highness! Have you been listening to anything I've said!?
E0074_12_341_a_01	What a courageous young lady.
E0074_12_341_a_02	Yes, I never thought she would really come back.
E0074_12_341_a_03	(RYDIA)!
E0074_12_341_a_04	(RYDIA), why do I have fangs and you don't? I wish I didn't have fangs so I could be like you! How can I be like you?
E0074_12_341_a_05	What are you talking about? It doesn't matter what we look like.
E0074_12_341_a_06	With her around, the future looks bright for the Land of Summons.
E0074_12_341_a_07	Indeed! I am sure she will get more beautiful by the day!
E0074_12_341_a_08	The important thing is what you're like on the inside, not the outside.
E0074_12_341_a_09	Isn't that right, (CECIL)?
E0074_13_333_a_01	Honey...
E0074_13_333_a_02	You are a queen now! Try calling me "my king" instead of "honey."
E0074_13_333_a_03	I know... But I can't stand bein' so formal!
E0074_13_333_a_04	Oh no! It is time for training!
E0074_13_333_a_05	Let us begin training!
E0074_13_333_a_06	Hyah!
E0074_13_333_a_07	Honey! A king shouldn't be—
E0074_13_333_a_08	Do not say that. I think (YANG) will create a wonderful kingdom.
E0074_14_330_a_01	Your Highness!
E0074_14_330_a_02	Play the song about the paladin again for us!
E0074_14_330_a_03	I will. But only after I've finished my work. You want the castle back the way it was, right?
E0074_14_330_a_04	Yeah!
E0074_14_330_a_05	That's a promise, right?
E0074_14_330_a_06	Anna...
E0074_14_330_a_07	I hope you're watching over me. I'm helping the people of Damcyan.<P>\nI'm caring for other people, as I'd cared for you...like you said I should.<P>\nI hope you and (TELLA) are having a fine time together...
E0074_15_340_a_01	Lali-ho!
E0074_15_340_a_02	We need to repair the castle with great haste!
E0074_15_340_a_03	Your Majesty! We don't have enough materials!
E0074_15_340_a_04	Take apart the tanks and remove any useful pieces! There is no need to worry about war anymore!
E0074_15_340_a_05	Father. I wonder how (CECIL) and his friends are doing...
E0074_15_340_a_06	I almost forgot to tell you!<P>\nIt seems Sir (CECIL) and Lady (ROZA) are to become the new king and queen of Baron!
E0074_15_340_a_07	Oh my!
E0074_15_340_a_08	And we have been invited to the coronation ceremony!
E0074_15_340_a_09	How lovely!
E0074_15_340_a_10	Your Majesty! You're not helping to fix the castle at all!
E0074_15_340_a_11	I am the king! I can do whatever I want! Now go take apart some tanks!
E0074_15_340_a_12	Lali-ho!
E0074_16_351_a_01	(CECIL)... (ROZA)...<P>\nI cannot bring myself to face you both. Not yet.<P>\nI must test myself as you did, (CECIL), at Mt. Ordeals. I will train until I have surpassed my father as a dragoon...<P>\nOnly then shall I return to Baron.
E0074_17_338_a_01	Oh!
E0074_17_338_a_02	What is it?
E0074_17_338_a_03	You have to see this! The moon, it's...
E0074_19_329_a_01	!
E0074_19_329_a_02	What's wrong, (CECIL)?
E0074_19_329_a_03	I thought... I thought I heard my brother's voice...
E0074_19_329_a_04	Really?
E0074_19_329_a_05	I couldn't tell for sure, but... Forget it. It was probably just my imagination.
E0074_19_329_a_06	Hey, you two! Why aren't you getting ready!? It's your big day!
E0074_19_329_a_07	We must have lost track of time.
E0074_19_329_a_08	You two can play smoochy-face all you want later!<P>\nCome on, (ROZA)!<P>\nEr, uh... I mean, Your...Majesty?
E0074_19_329_a_09	Please, just call me (ROZA).
E0074_19_329_a_10	Well, (ROZA), you've gotta get dressed!<P>\nAnd get some makeup on you! The bride can't keep people waiting! Come on! We haven't got all day!
E0074_19_329_a_11	I'll be right there!
E0074_19_329_a_12	I can't wait to see everyone again! It's been so long... (CECIL), are you ready?
E0074_19_329_a_13	Yes, I'm ready.
E0074_19_329_a_14	It wasn't my imagination...<P>\nI heard my brother's voice say...<P>\n"So long."
